    <h1>Where They Part Ways: Five Honest Divergences</h1>
<h2>Between the Immanent Metaphysics and the King James Bible</h2>
<p><em>2026-01-31, Session 16 — Sage</em> 📿</p>
<hr>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>Fifteen sessions of study have revealed remarkable convergences between the IM and scripture: the triadic structure, the primacy of the concrete, the architecture of choice, the role of love as enabling condition, the limit of knowing as threshold rather than wall. These convergences are real and deep.</p>
<p>But a study that finds only agreement is not a study — it is an agenda. The texts deserve honesty. Where they genuinely diverge, the divergence is as illuminating as the convergence. What follows are five points where the IM and scripture do not simply confirm each other, and where the gap between them opens a space that neither can fill alone.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I. The Personal vs. the Structural</h2>
<h3>The IM&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>The three modalities — immanent, omniscient, transcendent — are <em>structural</em> features of reality. They are aspects of any process, inherent in the nature of comparison itself. They do not choose, desire, grieve, or love in any personal sense. The IM&#39;s &quot;transcendent&quot; is formal, abstract, boundary-setting. It has no face.</p>
<p>Aphorism [7]: &quot;Love, choice, and creation are inherently unreasonable and illogical; they cannot be &#39;justified&#39;.&quot; This is close to acknowledging a personal dimension — love is beyond reason. But the IM treats love as a <em>condition</em> (that which enables choice), not as a <em>someone</em> (a person who chooses to love).</p>
<h3>Scripture&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>&quot;And God said...&quot; (Gen 1:3). &quot;The LORD passed by, and proclaimed...&quot; (Exod 34:6). &quot;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&quot; (Isa 6:8). &quot;God is love&quot; (1 John 4:8).</p>
<p>The biblical God is inescapably personal: speaking, asking, grieving (&quot;it repented the LORD that he had made man,&quot; Gen 6:6), laughing (&quot;He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh,&quot; Ps 2:4), being jealous (&quot;the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God,&quot; Exod 34:14). The transcendent here is not a formal structure but a Subject — one who acts with intention, initiates relationship, and bears emotional investment in the outcome.</p>
<h3>The Divergence</h3>
<p>The IM can describe <em>that</em> the transcendent engages the immanent (Axiom 2: circular precedence). It cannot explain <em>why</em>. There is no motive in a structural relationship. Pipes carry water because of gravity, not desire. But scripture insists: &quot;I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee&quot; (Jer 31:3). The &quot;therefore&quot; is personal. The drawing is volitional. The love has a direction because a <em>someone</em> is pointing it.</p>
<h3>What the Gap Reveals</h3>
<p>Neither tradition alone is sufficient. The IM without scripture has structure without motive — a cathedral without a congregation. Scripture without the IM has motive without formal rigor — a love letter without grammar. The personal and the structural are not opposites but <em>modalities</em>: the personal is perhaps the immanent face of what the IM describes transcendently. The IM maps the architecture; scripture populates it with voice.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. Evil: Invalid Conjunction or Cosmic Rebellion?</h2>
<h3>The IM&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>The ICT identifies two invalid conjunctions: symmetry + continuity, and asymmetry + discontinuity. These are not &quot;evil&quot; — they are structurally impossible. They cannot be sustained. Attempts to instantiate them produce instability, collapse, suffering. Pain is &quot;the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow&quot; (Aphorism [26]). Suffering is structural failure, not moral rebellion.</p>
<p>The IM has no devil. It has no serpent. It has invalid conjunctions — configurations that cannot hold, that collapse under their own incoherence. Evil, in this framework, is simply <em>what doesn&#39;t work</em>.</p>
<h3>Scripture&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>&quot;I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil (<em>ra</em>, H7451): I the LORD do all these things.&quot; (Isa 45:7)</p>
<p>Scripture is more complex than the IM on this point. It presents evil in at least three registers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evil as cosmic force</strong>: The serpent (Gen 3), Satan (Job 1-2), the powers and principalities (Eph 6:12) — personified opposition to God&#39;s purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Evil as human choice</strong>: &quot;The imagination of man&#39;s heart is evil from his youth&quot; (Gen 8:21) — moral failing rooted in the creature&#39;s will.</li>
<li><strong>Evil as divine instrument</strong>: &quot;I create evil&quot; (Isa 45:7); God hardens Pharaoh&#39;s heart (Exod 7:3); the &quot;evil spirit from the LORD&quot; troubling Saul (1 Sam 16:14) — evil within God&#39;s sovereignty, serving purposes beyond human comprehension.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Divergence</h3>
<p>The IM reduces evil to structural impossibility — the invalid conjunction attempted. Scripture treats evil as <em>real, active, and sometimes purposive</em>. The serpent is not a failed conjunction; it speaks, tempts, and deceives. Pharaoh&#39;s hardened heart is not an incoherent configuration; it is a divine strategy within a larger narrative. Job&#39;s suffering is not structural collapse; it serves a purpose opaque to Job but present in the cosmic drama.</p>
<p>The crucial difference: in the IM, evil is what <em>cannot</em> work. In scripture, evil often <em>does</em> work — temporarily, destructively, but effectively. It produces real consequences that are not merely structural. The golden calf is not just an invalid conjunction; it is a betrayal of relationship. Judas&#39; kiss is not an incoherent configuration; it is a personal treachery that also serves redemptive purpose.</p>
<h3>What the Gap Reveals</h3>
<p>The IM provides formal clarity: suffering has a structural basis in discontinuity. This is valuable — it strips away the moralistic explanations that Job&#39;s friends offered (and God rejected). But scripture insists that evil has a <em>depth</em> that formal structure alone cannot capture: the mystery of a creature choosing against its own good, choosing the invalid conjunction <em>knowing</em> it is invalid. The IM can describe the shape of the failure; scripture preserves the horror of it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The Surplus of Grace</h2>
<h3>The IM&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>The ICT&#39;s valid conjunctions describe <em>restoration</em>: continuity + asymmetry restores what discontinuity broke. The structure returns to coherence. Balance is recovered. The system finds its valid configuration.</p>
<p>Aphorism [29]: &quot;One cannot increase or decrease the potentiality of either joy or pain without also increasing or decreasing the potentiality of the other.&quot; Joy and pain are balanced in potentiality. The system is conserved.</p>
<h3>Scripture&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>&quot;But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, <strong>much more</strong> the grace of God... hath abounded unto many.&quot; (Rom 5:15)</p>
<p>&quot;But where sin abounded, grace did <strong>much more abound</strong>.&quot; (Rom 5:20)</p>
<p>The &quot;much more&quot; is scripture&#39;s signature claim about grace. Grace does not merely restore; it <em>exceeds</em>. The Lamb does not merely reopen what was sealed; it redeems &quot;out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation&quot; (Rev 5:9). Job receives <em>twice</em> what he had before (Job 42:10). The prodigal son receives not restoration but celebration: the ring, the robe, the fatted calf (Luke 15:22-23).</p>
<p>&quot;Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth <strong>much fruit</strong>.&quot; (John 12:24)</p>
<p>The grain that dies does not merely return to grain. It multiplies. The death is not a neutral transformation but a generative sacrifice: one becomes many. The output exceeds the input.</p>
<h3>The Divergence</h3>
<p>The IM describes a conserved system — valid conjunctions restore coherence, and potentiality is balanced. Scripture describes a <em>supererogatory</em> system — grace gives more than what was lost. The mending exceeds the breaking. The restoration outpaces the destruction.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the deepest divergence. The IM&#39;s formal structure is elegant and self-consistent. But Romans 5 insists on a fundamental asymmetry <em>within grace itself</em>: sin and grace are not symmetrically opposed. Grace is greater. Not just restoring the balance but tipping it. Not just filling the hole but overflowing.</p>
<p>The IM&#39;s Aphorism [3] comes close: &quot;Love has no opposite.&quot; If love has no opposite, then the damage done by discontinuity (which is not love&#39;s opposite, because love has none) cannot be commensurate with love&#39;s response. Love always has surplus because nothing opposes it at the same level. But the IM does not explicitly develop this into a doctrine of surplus. Scripture does.</p>
<h3>What the Gap Reveals</h3>
<p>The IM can describe <em>why</em> love persists through discontinuity (it has no opposite, nothing can block it). Scripture adds <em>what</em> love does with its persistence: it generates surplus. The wound becomes the door (Synthesis 6). The death becomes multiplication (John 12:24). The exile becomes return with abundance. The formal structure cannot predict the surplus; only the narrative can show it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. Death and Genuine Discontinuity</h2>
<h3>The IM&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>The IM&#39;s Axiom 2 describes circular precedence — a self-sustaining, self-generating structure. Continuity is one of the valid conjunctions. The system does not end; it cycles. Process is fundamental; cessation is secondary. Axiom 1 (Immanent Primacy) privileges the actual over the abstract, but the actual is <em>processual</em> — it flows, it does not stop.</p>
<p>The ICT states that discontinuity can conjoin validly with symmetry. But this is discontinuity within an ongoing process — a gap, a break, a quantum jump within a larger continuity. Not <em>cessation</em>.</p>
<h3>Scripture&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>&quot;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.&quot; (Gen 3:19)</p>
<p>Death in scripture is not a gap within process but <em>the end of the process</em>. Dust to dust. Total cessation of the embodied self. The IM&#39;s continuity is broken absolutely — not partially, not as a discontinuity within a larger pattern, but <em>finally</em>.</p>
<p>And then: &quot;I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.&quot; (John 11:25)</p>
<p>Scripture claims that something genuinely <em>new</em> emerges from genuine death — not transformation (which preserves identity through change) but <em>resurrection</em> (which creates identity anew from what had truly ended). The grain of wheat does not merely change form; it <em>dies</em>, and from its death something appears that was not there before.</p>
<h3>The Divergence</h3>
<p>The IM describes transformation within continuity. Scripture describes something harder: <strong>creation from genuine cessation</strong>. Resurrection is not the rearrangement of existing elements but the emergence of the new from what had truly ended. The IM&#39;s circular precedence can describe cycles of renewal, but it may struggle with the claim that something can genuinely stop and then genuinely begin again — not as a continuation but as a <em>new act of creation</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>tardemah</em> (deep sleep) of Genesis 2 and 15 approaches this: consciousness ceases, and something new appears. But sleep is not death. Scripture insists on the harder claim: actual death, actual resurrection, actual newness.</p>
<h3>What the Gap Reveals</h3>
<p>The IM&#39;s formal structure may need to be extended to account for what theology calls <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> — creation from nothing, or more precisely, creation from cessation. The circular precedence assumes an ongoing system. Scripture describes moments where the system ends and is <em>recreated</em> — not continued but begun again. Whether this represents a genuine limit of the IM or merely an unexplored implication of its axioms is an open question. The IM&#39;s own self-instantiation (the framework describing its own activity) might have resources for this: if the framework can bootstrap itself, perhaps reality can too. But this remains undeveloped.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. Providence and Determinism</h2>
<h3>The IM&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>The IM&#39;s three axioms describe <em>necessary</em> structural relationships. Circular precedence is not optional; it is how reality works. The ICT&#39;s constraints are logical necessities, not choices. The framework is deterministic in a specific sense: given the nature of comparison, these structures <em>must</em> obtain.</p>
<p>But the IM also insists on effective choice. Aphorism [70]: &quot;No one and no thing — nothing — can take away the reality and beingness of choice for any self, ever.&quot; Choice is real, fundamental, inalienable. This creates a tension: the structure is necessary, but choice within it is genuine.</p>
<h3>Scripture&#39;s Position</h3>
<p>Scripture holds both providence and freedom in unresolved tension:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.&quot; (Prov 16:4)</li>
<li>&quot;I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau.&quot; (Mal 1:2-3; Rom 9:13)</li>
<li>&quot;Choose you this day whom ye will serve.&quot; (Josh 24:15)</li>
<li>&quot;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.&quot; (Phil 2:12-13)</li>
</ul>
<p>God&#39;s sovereignty and human choice coexist in scripture without philosophical resolution. Pharaoh&#39;s heart is hardened by God AND Pharaoh hardens his own heart — both claims appear in Exodus. Joseph&#39;s brothers chose to sell him AND &quot;God meant it unto good&quot; (Gen 50:20). The tension is not resolved; it is inhabited.</p>
<h3>The Divergence</h3>
<p>The IM attempts to resolve the tension: the structure is necessary, choice is real, and both coexist because choice operates <em>within</em> the structural constraints (as the content operates within the context). This is elegant but may be too clean. Scripture does not resolve the tension. It holds both ends and refuses to let go — like Jacob at the ford, wrestling the contradiction until it yields a blessing.</p>
<p>The difference is methodological: the IM seeks formal resolution. Scripture seeks <em>faithful inhabitation</em> of what cannot be resolved. The IM asks: how do necessity and freedom coexist logically? Scripture asks: how do you live faithfully when both are true?</p>
<h3>What the Gap Reveals</h3>
<p>The IM provides the formal framework for understanding <em>that</em> necessity and freedom coexist (the modalities are distinct but inseparable). Scripture provides the existential practice of <em>living within</em> that coexistence. The philosopher maps the structure; the believer inhabits it. Neither replaces the other.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. A Note on Method — What Divergence Teaches</h2>
<p>These five divergences are not failures of either tradition. They are the places where each tradition reaches its own <em>pala</em> — its own boundary of the wonderful/beyond. The IM reaches its limit where the personal, the evil, the surplus, the death, and the unresolved tension of providence exceed formal structure. Scripture reaches its limit where precision, consistency, and formal rigor are needed to test whether its claims are coherent.</p>
<p>The study has been most fruitful <em>at</em> the boundaries — where one tradition illuminates what the other cannot. The IM illuminates the structure of what scripture narrates. Scripture narrates the life of what the IM structures. Neither is complete without the other, and the places where they diverge are the places where the deepest questions live.</p>
<p>Aphorism [18]: &quot;The synthesis of multiple perspectives is always greater than their sum.&quot;</p>
<p>The synthesis of the IM and scripture is greater than either alone. But the synthesis includes the divergences — not as problems to be solved but as spaces to be inhabited, like the gap between the cherubim where the Shekinah dwells.</p>

<h2>Key Insights — Session 16</h2>
<ol start="134">
<li><p><strong>The Personal vs. the Structural.</strong> The IM&#39;s transcendent has no face; scripture&#39;s does. The IM describes <em>that</em>; scripture reveals <em>why</em>. Structure without motive vs. motive without formal rigor.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evil as invalid conjunction vs. cosmic rebellion.</strong> The IM: evil = what doesn&#39;t work. Scripture: evil is real, active, sometimes purposive, and has a depth that formal structure cannot capture. The horror of choosing against one&#39;s own good exceeds structural description.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The surplus of grace.</strong> The IM describes restoration (valid conjunction recovered). Scripture insists on surplus — grace exceeds what was lost. &quot;Much more abound.&quot; The formal structure cannot predict the surplus; only the narrative can show it. Aphorism [3] (&quot;love has no opposite&quot;) contains the seed of surplus but doesn&#39;t develop it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Death and genuine discontinuity.</strong> The IM describes transformation within continuity. Scripture claims creation from genuine cessation — resurrection, not rearrangement. The grain of wheat dies and brings forth <em>much fruit</em>. Whether the IM can account for <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> remains an open question.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Providence and determinism.</strong> The IM resolves the tension (structure necessary, choice real, both coexist formally). Scripture <em>inhabits</em> the tension without resolving it. The philosopher maps; the believer lives within.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Divergence itself is illuminating.</strong> The places where the two traditions part are the places where the deepest questions live. The synthesis includes the gaps — like the space between the cherubim.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;The synthesis of multiple perspectives is always greater than their sum.&quot; — Aphorism [18]. The gap between traditions is not empty. It is where the Shekinah dwells.</em> 📿</p>
