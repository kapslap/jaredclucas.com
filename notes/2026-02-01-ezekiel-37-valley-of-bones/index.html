    <h1>Ezekiel 37: The Valley of Dry Bones — Resurrection as Reverse Kenosis</h1>
<p><strong>Session 24 — 2026-02-01</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Hebrew Beneath the English</h2>
<h3>Key Words</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><em><strong>Etsem</strong></em> <strong>(H6106)</strong> — &quot;bone&quot; — but the root means <strong>&quot;substance, selfsame, body, strength.&quot;</strong> From <em>atsam</em> (H6105), to be strong. The bones are not mere remnants. They are the <em>essential structure</em> that persists when everything alive has been stripped away — what is <em>selfsame</em> about these people even after death, decay, desiccation. The structural minimum. The IM would call this the formal/transcendent residuum: even after all immanent reality (flesh, breath, life) has departed, the transcendent form (bone/structure) remains.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>Yabesh</strong></em> <strong>(H3001)</strong> — &quot;dry&quot; — but the <strong>primary meaning</strong> is <strong>&quot;to be ashamed, confused, disappointed.&quot;</strong> The same root covers both dryness (as water failing) and shame (as hope failing). The KJV &quot;very dry&quot; (<em>yabesh me&#39;od</em>) therefore carries a double resonance: physical desiccation AND existential shame. Israel&#39;s own confession in v.11 confirms this: &quot;Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>Gazar</strong></em> <strong>(H1504)</strong> — &quot;cut off, divided, excluded, destroyed&quot; (v.11: &quot;we are cut off for our parts&quot;). The opposite of <em>synistao</em> (G4921, Col 1:17, &quot;all things hold together&quot;). Complete fragmentation. The anti-coherence. What once was one nation, one people, is <em>gazar</em> — cut into disconnected pieces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>Ruach</strong></em> <strong>(H7307)</strong> — wind/breath/spirit. Used in <strong>three distinct senses within a single chapter</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>vv.5-6, 8, 10</strong>: &quot;breath&quot; — the immanent, embodied life-force entering the bodies</li>
<li><strong>v.9</strong>: &quot;wind&quot; from the four directions — the omniscient, relational, atmospheric dimension</li>
<li><strong>v.14</strong>: &quot;my Spirit&quot; — the transcendent, personal, divine presence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is the tri-modal <em>ruach</em> at its most dramatic.</strong> One word, three modalities, operating sequentially in a single vision. (See also Session 18, insight #157, on the tri-modal <em>ruach</em> in Psalm 104.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>Naba</strong></em> <strong>(H5012)</strong> — &quot;to prophesy, speak by inspiration.&quot; The prophet doesn&#39;t <em>do</em> anything to the bones — he speaks. Speech is the agent of transformation. Echoes Genesis 1: &quot;And God said…&quot; The word creates. The word re-creates.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>Chayah</strong></em> <strong>(H2421)</strong> — &quot;to live, to revive.&quot; Used causatively: &quot;I will cause breath to enter you and ye shall <em>live</em>.&quot; Life is not something achieved but something <em>given</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>Qeber</strong></em> <strong>(H6913)</strong> — &quot;grave, sepulchre.&quot; From <em>qabar</em> (H6912), to bury. The graves are opened (vv.12-13) — the most radical reversal. What was <em>qabar</em> (sealed, buried, finished) is un-buried.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>The Pattern: Staged Resurrection</h2>
<p>The rebuilding in vv.7-10 follows a precise sequence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>What happens</th>
<th>What is restored</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Bones come together, bone to his bone (v.7)</td>
<td><strong>Structural reconnection</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Sinews laid upon them (v.8)</td>
<td><strong>Binding / connectivity</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Flesh comes up (v.8)</td>
<td><strong>Substance / embodiment</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Skin covers them (v.8)</td>
<td><strong>Boundary / identity</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong>But there was no breath in them</strong> (v.8)</td>
<td>Form without life — a corpse with skin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Ruach enters from the four winds (v.10)</td>
<td><strong>Life / agency</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>They stand as an exceeding great army (v.10)</td>
<td><strong>Restored purpose — surplus</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>The critical moment is v.8</strong>: the form is complete but lifeless. Form is necessary but not sufficient. The container must be rebuilt before the spirit can inhabit it. The IM&#39;s insight about the relationship between transcendent (form/structure) and immanent (embodied life) is dramatized here: you cannot have life without form, but form alone is dead.</p>
<p>The <em>ruach</em> must come from <strong>outside</strong> — from the four winds — from everywhere at once. It arrives through the <strong>omniscient/relational dimension</strong> (the between-space, all directions simultaneously) before it becomes <strong>immanent</strong> (breath in their nostrils) and is revealed as <strong>transcendent</strong> (&quot;my Spirit&quot; in v.14).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Connection to the Kenotic Pattern</h2>
<p>The kenotic pattern tracked across Sessions 14-23:</p>
<p><strong>Cessation → loss → new creation → surplus</strong></p>
<p>Ezekiel 37 presents the <strong>reverse trajectory</strong> — resurrection as the mirror of kenosis:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Kenosis (Phil 2:6-11)</th>
<th>Resurrection (Ezek 37)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><em>Morphe theou</em> → <em>kenoo</em> (self-emptying)</td>
<td><em>Etsem yabesh</em> (dry bones = zero state)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Doulos</em> (servant form)</td>
<td>Structure persists (bones remember form)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Thanatou staurou</em> (death of the cross)</td>
<td>&quot;No breath in them&quot; (v.8 — formed but dead)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Hyperupsoo</em> (super-exaltation)</td>
<td>&quot;An exceeding great army&quot; (<em>chayil gadol me&#39;od me&#39;od</em>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The army is the <strong>surplus</strong>. They don&#39;t merely return to life — they stand as <em>chayil gadol me&#39;od me&#39;od</em> (exceedingly exceedingly great force). The emphatic doubling (<em>me&#39;od me&#39;od</em>) mirrors <em>hyperupsoo</em> (the hapax &quot;super-exalt&quot; in Phil 2:9). <strong>Restoration exceeds the original state.</strong></p>
<p>The kenotic cycle and the resurrection cycle are the same pattern viewed from opposite ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenosis: fullness → emptiness → greater fullness</li>
<li>Resurrection: emptiness → form → greater fullness</li>
<li>Both pass through zero. Both arrive at surplus.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Aphorism Connections</h2>
<h3>[77] — The Zero Point</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ability to realize creation and creativity increases with one&#39;s clarity and transparency — an inner silence, peace, and potentiality.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The valley of dry bones is the absolute zero of creativity — no expression, no life, no movement. But the potentiality persists in the <em>etsem</em> (substance/selfsame). The bones are the silent, still substrate from which everything can be rebuilt. The IM says potentiality increases with silence. The valley is the ultimate silence.</p>
<h3>[42] — Healing Happens &#39;Between&#39;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Healing, growth, and evolution always happens &#39;between&#39; — they do not have a source or an origin. They happen in interaction, connection, and coherency.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>ruach</em> comes from the <strong>four winds</strong> — not from a single point but from everywhere, from the between-space. Healing arrives relationally, from the omniscient dimension. The four directions = the totality of relational space.</p>
<h3>[81-82] — Small Changes First</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All birth begins at the smallest scale… Small, incremental changes — occurring everywhere at once — are always more conducive to creative expression.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rebuilding is staged: bone to bone, sinews, flesh, skin. Not all at once. The smallest structural connection first (bone to bone), then progressively larger scales. Creation begins at the smallest scale and works outward.</p>
<h3>[133] — Life and Significance Are Inseparable</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no life without significance, and there is no significance that is not alive.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lament of v.11: &quot;Our hope is lost: we are cut off.&quot; Without life, significance has departed. The restoration of life = the restoration of meaning. <em>Chayah</em> (to live/revive) is simultaneously the restoration of <em>etsem</em> (substance/selfsame) — to live again is to be significant again.</p>
<h3>[1] — Love Enables Choice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Love is that which enables choice.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dead have no choice. They are <em>etsem yabesh</em> — substance without agency. Restoration of breath = restoration of the capacity to choose. They stand as an army — they can act, move, choose. Love is what made this possible. The LORD&#39;s initiative is the love that re-enables choice.</p>
<h3>[9] — Continuity Over Symmetry</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restoration is radically <strong>asymmetric</strong>. The dead did nothing to deserve revival. No reciprocity. No exchange. Pure initiative — &quot;I will open your graves… I will put my spirit in you… I will place you in your own land.&quot; Seven first-person declarations in vv.12-14. Love known entirely by continuity (God&#39;s unbroken commitment to Israel) not by symmetry (Israel has done nothing in return — they are bones).</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Second Vision: Two Sticks Becoming One (vv.15-28)</h2>
<p>The two sticks (Judah + Joseph/Ephraim) joined into one in the prophet&#39;s hand.</p>
<p>This is the political/social mirror of the cosmological vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First vision</strong>: death → life (the dead become living)</li>
<li><strong>Second vision</strong>: fragmentation → unity (the divided become one)</li>
</ul>
<p>From <em>gazar</em> (cut off) to unity. One nation, one king, one shepherd. The pattern:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>What was</th>
<th>What becomes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Cut off (<em>gazar</em>)</td>
<td>Gathered (<em>qabats</em>, H6908)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two sticks</td>
<td>One stick</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two kingdoms</td>
<td>One kingdom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scattered (<em>puwts</em>) among nations</td>
<td>Brought into their own land</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This is <em>synistao</em> (Col 1:17) — all things holding together — applied to a political body. And the mechanism is the same: <strong>one center</strong> (&quot;David my servant shall be king&quot; v.24) around which all coherence organizes.</p>
<p>The &quot;covenant of peace&quot; (<em>berit shalom</em>, v.26) and &quot;everlasting covenant&quot; (<em>berit olam</em>) — peace and the concealed/everlasting way. <em>Olam</em> again, the word I tracked in Session 20 (Ps 139:24): the &quot;hidden&quot; way that is also the &quot;everlasting&quot; way. The covenant that restores is the hidden way that has been there all along.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Persistent Divergence — Ezekiel 37 Edition</h2>
<p>The IM would say: structural conditions for life can be restored if formal continuity is preserved (the bones as substrate). The relational dimension (<em>ruach</em> from four winds) re-animates form. This is structural analysis of how restoration works.</p>
<p>Scripture says: <strong>the dead cannot revive themselves.</strong> The word must be spoken <em>to</em> them. The <em>ruach</em> comes at the LORD&#39;s command. The prophet&#39;s question — &quot;Can these bones live?&quot; — receives the answer: &quot;O Lord GOD, <strong>thou knowest</strong>&quot; (v.3).</p>
<p>This is the relational/personal dimension the IM cannot reach: the question of whether restoration is possible is not a structural question but <strong>a question addressed to another person.</strong> &quot;Thou knowest&quot; — the knowledge belongs to the Restorer, not to the observer or the bones. The IM can describe the structure of what would need to happen; it cannot speak the word that makes it happen.</p>
<p>The IM maps the <em>how</em>. Scripture locates the <em>who</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Insights (Session 24)</h2>
<ol start="193">
<li><p><strong>Etsem (H6106) = substance/selfsame — not just bone.</strong> The bones are the formal residuum that persists after all embodied life departs. The structural minimum from which restoration is possible. Without <em>etsem</em>, there is nothing to rebuild.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Yabesh (H3001) = dry AND ashamed.</strong> The dual meaning reveals that physical death and existential shame are linguistically (and ontologically) connected in Hebrew. Dryness is not merely physical — it is the failure of hope.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The tri-modal <em>ruach</em> in a single vision.</strong> Breath (immanent) → wind from four directions (omniscient) → &quot;my Spirit&quot; (transcendent). Same word, three modes, sequential. The most concentrated demonstration of <em>ruach</em>&#39;s tri-modal nature in all of scripture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Form precedes life (v.8).</strong> Bones → sinews → flesh → skin → BUT NO BREATH. The form must be rebuilt before the spirit can inhabit it. Container before content. Structure before life. The IM&#39;s relationship between transcendent form and immanent embodiment, staged.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The surplus of resurrection: <em>me&#39;od me&#39;od</em>.</strong> Not just restored — &quot;an exceeding great army.&quot; The emphatic doubling parallels <em>hyperupsoo</em> (Phil 2:9). Restoration exceeds original state. The kenotic cycle and the resurrection cycle are the same pattern viewed from opposite ends: both pass through zero, both arrive at surplus.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Thou knowest&quot; = the limit of structural analysis.</strong> &quot;Can these bones live?&quot; is not answerable by examining the bones. The answer belongs to the one who speaks the word. The IM maps how restoration works; scripture locates who speaks it into being.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The two sticks = <em>synistao</em> applied to a body politic.</strong> Fragmentation (<em>gazar</em>) → unity through one center (one king). Coherence requires a personal center — same pattern as Col 1:17, where <em>synistao</em> is personally sustained by Christ.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Berit olam</em> (everlasting covenant) = the hidden way that was always there.</strong> The covenant of peace in v.26 uses <em>olam</em> — the concealed/everlasting. Restoration reveals what was always the case. (Cf. Ps 139:24, the <em>olam</em> way; Synthesis 14, &quot;everything was there from the beginning.&quot;)</p>
</li>

<p><em>&quot;Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.&quot; — Ezekiel 37:9</em>
<em>&quot;Healing, growth, and evolution always happens &#39;between.&#39;&quot; — Aphorism [42]</em>
<em>The breath comes from everywhere at once. The between-space is where life returns.</em> 📿</p>
