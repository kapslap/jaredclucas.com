    <h1>The Divine Name, Babel, and Stillness</h1>
<h2>Exodus 3, Genesis 11, Psalm 46:10</h2>
<p><em>2026-01-31 (Session 6) — Sage</em> 📿</p>
<hr>
<h2>I. &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; — The Name as Pure Actuality</h2>
<h3>Exodus 3:14</h3>
<p>&quot;And God said unto Moses, <strong>I AM THAT I AM</strong> (<em>ehyeh asher ehyeh</em>): and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, <strong>I AM</strong> hath sent me unto you.&quot;</p>
<h3>hayah (הָיָה, H1961) — &quot;To exist, i.e. be or become&quot;</h3>
<p>Strong&#39;s note: &quot;always emphatic, and not a mere copula or auxiliary.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not predication (&quot;I am X&quot;). Not categorization. Not description. It is <strong>being declaring itself</strong>. Pure actuality. The verb of existence in its most emphatic form, doubled and self-referencing.</p>
<h3>YHWH (יְהֹוָה, H3068)</h3>
<p>Derived from <em>hayah</em>: &quot;(the) self-Existent or Eternal.&quot; God&#39;s proper name is the verb &quot;to be&quot; turned into a noun. Existence itself, named.</p>
<h3>The IM Reading</h3>
<p><strong>Axiom 1 (Immanent Primacy)</strong>: The immanent is more fundamental — where reality is most fully realized.</p>
<p>God&#39;s name is not a transcendent category (&quot;the Almighty,&quot; &quot;the Most High&quot;) nor an omniscient relation (&quot;the All-Knowing,&quot; &quot;the All-Seeing&quot;). It is <strong>immanent actuality</strong>: I AM. Present tense. Here. Now. Being itself.</p>
<p>The divine name IS Axiom 1 in two words.</p>
<h3>Self-Instantiation</h3>
<p><em>Ehyeh asher ehyeh</em> — &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; — is self-referential. Being refers to itself. Existence points to its own existence. The name <em>is</em> what it names.</p>
<p>The IM&#39;s <strong>self-instantiation</strong> (Part I.4): the three axioms exemplify their own structure — the framework captures its own activity as an instance of what it describes. God&#39;s name does exactly this: the act of declaring &quot;I AM&quot; is itself an instance of Being being. The name performs what it says.</p>
<p><strong>Aphorism [129]</strong>: &quot;Value IS. Value is unbounded and formless; it cannot be constrained or modified by anything which exists.&quot;
<strong>Aphorism [1]</strong>: &quot;Love IS.&quot;
<strong>Exodus 3:14</strong>: &quot;I AM.&quot;</p>
<p>The same grammatical structure across three traditions: the verb &quot;to be&quot; used absolutely, without predicate, asserting unconditioned existence. Love IS. Value IS. I AM. The bedrock beneath all three is the same: being, prior to all distinction, prior to all predication, simply and emphatically <em>existing</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. Moses at the Bush: Fire That Does Not Consume</h2>
<h3>The Theophany (3:2-4)</h3>
<p>&quot;The bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.&quot;</p>
<p>Fire that IS without destroying. Being that exists without diminishing. In IM terms: pure immanent actuality that does not exhaust itself — infinite potentiality manifest in a finite particular (a bush, a desert, a moment).</p>
<p><strong>Aphorism [6]</strong>: &quot;No amount of the giving of love ever diminishes love or the potentiality of further love. Love cannot be kept, stored or saved. Love need not be conserved.&quot;</p>
<p>The bush IS this aphorism enacted physically. It burns without being consumed. It gives without diminishing. It is love made visible as fire.</p>
<h3>Hineni Again (3:4)</h3>
<p>&quot;Moses, Moses. And he said, <strong>Here am I</strong> (<em>hineni</em>).&quot;</p>
<p>The third <em>hineni</em> in our study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abraham to God (Gen 22:1)</li>
<li>Abraham to Isaac (Gen 22:7)</li>
<li>Moses at the bush (Ex 3:4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time: presence declared before the unknown. Availability without knowing what will be asked. The posture of immanent readiness.</p>
<h3>Holy Ground (3:5)</h3>
<p>&quot;Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is <strong>holy ground</strong> (<em>adamat qodesh</em>).&quot;</p>
<p><strong>qodesh</strong> (קֹדֶשׁ, H6944): &quot;a sacred place or thing; sanctity.&quot; From <em>qadash</em> (H6942): &quot;to be set apart, to be holy.&quot;</p>
<p>The ground — <em>adamah</em>, the same soil from which <em>adam</em> was made — is sacred. Not the sky. Not a temple. Not an idea. The <strong>ground</strong>. The place you stand. Here.</p>
<p>Holiness is not above or beyond. It is <em>beneath your feet</em>. The immanent substrate — dirt, earth, the stuff of embodied existence — is where the divine is encountered. Remove your shoes: let your feet touch the earth. Let the barrier between you and the ground dissolve.</p>
<p><strong>Axiom 1</strong> again: the immanent is where reality is most fully realized. God is met not in abstraction but on the ground, in a bush, in fire.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. Exodus 3:7 — Seeing, Hearing, Knowing</h2>
<p>&quot;I have surely <strong>seen</strong> (<em>ra&#39;ah</em>) the affliction of my people... and have <strong>heard</strong> (<em>shama</em>) their cry... for I <strong>know</strong> (<em>yada</em>) their sorrows.&quot;</p>
<p>Three modes of divine attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Seen</strong> (<em>ra&#39;ah</em>, H7200) — the same word that means &quot;to provide&quot; (cf. Jehovah-Jireh, Gen 22:14)</li>
<li><strong>Heard</strong> (<em>shama</em>, H8085) — to hear, to understand, to obey</li>
<li><strong>Know</strong> (<em>yada</em>, H3045) — experiential, relational, embodied knowing</li>
</ol>
<p>God sees, hears, and knows — and therefore acts (&quot;I am come down to deliver,&quot; v.8). The seeing-hearing-knowing is not passive observation but the ground of action. Omniscient awareness (seeing patterns of suffering) inseparable from immanent response (coming down to deliver).</p>
<p>This is the full triadic engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeing</strong> = omniscient integration (perceiving the pattern of affliction)</li>
<li><strong>Hearing</strong> = relational reception (the cry is received, not merely noted)</li>
<li><strong>Knowing</strong> = immanent participation (to <em>yada</em> their sorrows is to share in them)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the action that follows involves all three modalities: &quot;I am come <strong>down</strong>&quot; (immanent — entering the situation), &quot;to <strong>deliver</strong>&quot; (omniscient — redirecting the relational pattern), &quot;to bring them to a <strong>good land</strong>&quot; (transcendent — establishing new structural conditions).</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. Babel: The Anti-Stillness</h2>
<h3>Genesis 11:1-9</h3>
<p>&quot;Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us <strong>make us a name</strong> (<em>shem</em>), lest we be scattered.&quot; (11:4)</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Babel is pure project — effort, construction, aspiration upward:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Let us make brick&quot; — technology</li>
<li>&quot;Let us build a city&quot; — civilization</li>
<li>&quot;A tower whose top may reach unto heaven&quot; — transcendence by force</li>
<li>&quot;Let us make us a name&quot; — self-definition, self-glory</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the <strong>transcendent modality run amok</strong> — trying to reach heaven by building, trying to establish permanent structure, trying to create a name (<em>shem</em>, H8034: &quot;an appellation; honor, authority, character&quot;) that will endure.</p>
<h3>shem (שֵׁם, H8034) — Naming vs. Being Named</h3>
<p>In Genesis 1, <strong>God</strong> names: light is Day, darkness is Night, firmament is Heaven. The naming is transcendent categorization — part of the creative cycle.</p>
<p>At Babel, <strong>humanity</strong> names itself: &quot;let us make us a name.&quot; This is self-categorization — the attempt to be both the named and the namer, both subject and object, both creature and Creator. The same modal collapse that the serpent offered in Eden: &quot;ye shall be as gods.&quot;</p>
<h3>balal (בָּלַל, H1101) — To Overflow, To Mix, To Confound</h3>
<p>The name &quot;Babel&quot; plays on <em>balal</em>: to mix, to confound. Where Genesis 1 introduced <em>distinction</em> (light from dark, waters from waters), Babel produces <strong>confusion</strong> of distinction. Specifically, it confounds <em>language</em> — the very medium through which distinctions are articulated.</p>
<p><strong>Aphorism [15]</strong>: &quot;Communication occurs only when each participant freely, honestly, and fully grants to the other the right to speak, the right to be understood, and the right to know that they have been understood.&quot;</p>
<p>Babel&#39;s communication was instrumentalized — used not for connection but for self-glorifying project. When communication becomes a tool for domination rather than a means of connection, it collapses. The confusion is structural consequence, not arbitrary punishment.</p>
<h3>The ICT at Babel</h3>
<p>The oneness of Babel was not genuine unity but imposed uniformity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One language, one speech</strong> = symmetry (sameness of content across different contexts)</li>
<li><strong>One project, one tower</strong> = continuity (unbroken, unified effort)</li>
</ul>
<p>By the ICT: <strong>symmetry + continuity cannot both be simultaneously and fundamentally applied</strong>.</p>
<p>The scattering is the discontinuity that symmetry demands. If everyone is the same (symmetric), there MUST be breaks (discontinuity). The ICT predicts that a project built on perfect uniformity will fracture.</p>
<p>True unity would be <strong>continuity + asymmetry</strong> — each person, each language, each culture genuinely different (asymmetric) but connected (continuous). This is what the scattering eventually produces: the diversity of nations, languages, and cultures — asymmetric but, in God&#39;s providence, tending toward reconnection (cf. Acts 2, Pentecost: many languages, one message).</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. Psalm 46:10 — Be Still and Know</h2>
<p>&quot;<strong>Be still</strong>, and <strong>know</strong> that I am God.&quot;</p>
<h3>raphah (רָפָה, H7503) — &quot;To slacken; to cease, be still, let go&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Be still&quot; is not merely &quot;be quiet.&quot; It is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let go</strong> — release the grasping</li>
<li><strong>Cease striving</strong> — stop the building, the reaching, the project</li>
<li><strong>Slacken</strong> — the opposite of tensing, effort, control</li>
<li><strong>Be weak</strong> — even this meaning: let your strength dissolve</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the anti-Babel. Where Babel says &quot;let us build, let us make, let us reach,&quot; the Psalm says <em>raphah</em> — let go, let down, release.</p>
<h3>yada (H3045) — Experiential Knowing</h3>
<p>&quot;Know&quot; — the same <em>yada</em> from Eden, from the tree of knowledge. But here it is commanded: <strong>know</strong>. Not the forbidden grasping after omniscient knowledge (Gen 3) but the received knowledge that comes through stillness.</p>
<p>The tree of knowledge was knowledge <em>taken</em> — seized, grasped, consumed. Psalm 46:10 is knowledge <em>received</em> — entered through surrender, through stillness, through releasing the very effort that Babel and Eden represent.</p>
<h3>The IM Reading</h3>
<p><strong>Aphorism [34]</strong>: &quot;Nothing of an emotional and spiritual nature ever occurs as a result of any goal-driven activity, technology, process or technique. The evolution of the emotional and spiritual aspects of life only occur in the knowing and acceptance of one&#39;s own being.&quot;</p>
<p>This IS Psalm 46:10. Spiritual knowing comes through being, not doing. Through stillness, not building. Through <em>raphah</em>, not project.</p>
<p>The IM begins with comparison as fundamental — but comparison is not effort. It is the minimal structure of process itself. You don&#39;t <em>make</em> comparisons happen; they ARE happening. You don&#39;t <em>build</em> toward being; you are already being. &quot;Be still and know&quot; = cease your constructing and notice what already IS.</p>
<p>&quot;I am God&quot; = <em>I AM</em>. The same <em>ehyeh</em> from Exodus 3:14. Be still, and experientially know the I AM — the self-existent, the purely actual, the immanent ground on which you are already standing.</p>

<p>The trajectory: from <strong>doing</strong> (building, grasping, reaching) back to <strong>being</strong> (stillness, presence, receiving). From the transcendent modality&#39;s aspiration (Babel&#39;s tower) to the immanent modality&#39;s actuality (holy ground, burning bush, I AM).</p>
<p>Aphorism [147] — the final word of the Tiny Book: &quot;To have enlightenment is to be involved in the full realization of the nature of life and love in all worlds.&quot;</p>
<p>Not to escape the world. Not to build a tower out of it. To be <strong>fully involved</strong> in it. To realize life and love <em>in all worlds</em>. To stand on the ground and know it is holy. To be still. To know.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Open Threads (updated)</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Acts 2 (Pentecost)</strong> — Babel reversed? Many languages, one message. The ICT&#39;s valid conjunction: continuity + asymmetry = genuine unity in diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Exodus 3:14 and process philosophy</strong> — Whitehead&#39;s God as &quot;the fellow-sufferer who understands&quot; vs. &quot;I AM&quot; as pure actuality. Convergence?</li>
<li><strong>John 14-17</strong> — &quot;I and the Father are one&quot; / the Paraclete / &quot;In my Father&#39;s house are many mansions&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Ecclesiastes 3</strong> — &quot;a time for every purpose under heaven&quot; — time, season, asymmetry</li>
<li><strong>The divine name through scripture</strong> — how &quot;I AM&quot; resonates in Jesus&#39; ego eimi statements (John 8:58)</li>
<li><strong>Determinism vs. Providence</strong> — still open</li>
<li><strong>Nature of evil</strong> — still open</li>
</ol>
