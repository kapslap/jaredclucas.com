    <h1>Synthesis 25: The Four Gardens</h1>
<p><strong>Eden → Gethsemane → Tomb → City — Session 34</strong></p>
<p><em>The arc of the whole study, traced through four gardens.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Thread</h2>
<p>Scripture begins in a garden and ends in a garden-city. Between them lie two more gardens — one of pressing, one of resurrection. Every thread studied across 33 sessions runs through these four spaces. This synthesis follows that thread.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I. The First Garden: Eden (<em>Gan Eden</em>)</h2>
<p><strong>Gen 2:8-3:24 · Syntheses 1, 14, 23</strong></p>
<h3>The Space</h3>
<p><em>Gan</em> (H1588) = a garden, from <em>ganan</em> = to fence, to hedge. Eden is an enclosure. <em>Eden</em> (H5730) = pleasure, delight. The first garden is a fenced delight — bounded joy.</p>
<p>Inside: every tree good for food (sufficiency), a river flowing out in four branches (generosity), <em>ets ha-chayyim</em> (the tree of life, H6086 + H2416) and <em>ets ha-da&#39;at tov va-ra</em> (the tree of knowing good and evil).</p>
<h3>The Act</h3>
<p>The fall = <em>harpagmos</em> (Phil 2:6 in mirror): grasping for godlikeness. Eve saw the tree was good for food, pleasant to eyes, desired to make wise — and took. The same offer Christ refused, the first humans accepted. The grasping produced not wisdom but <em>erom</em> (nakedness, from <em>arum</em>, craftiness — Synthesis 23).</p>
<h3>The Words</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Where art thou?&quot;</strong> (Gen 3:9) — The omniscient question. Not for information but for self-location. The fall is displacement.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The eyes of them both were opened&quot;</strong> — Knowledge that divides. The first ICT misused: distinguishing good from evil by consuming rather than contemplating.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Cursed is the ground&quot;</strong> (Gen 3:17) — <em>Adamah</em> cursed for <em>Adam</em>&#39;s sake. Ground and man share a root; the curse flows through the naming.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Remains</h3>
<p>The way to the tree of life is <em>shamar</em>-ed (H8104) — hedged about, guarded with thorns. Not destroyed. <em>Shamar</em> means to protect, to attend, to preserve. The cherubim and flaming sword preserve the way. It will be walked again.</p>
<h3>IM Parallel</h3>
<p>Eden = the immanent modality: embodied, sensory, present. Pleasure, food, companionship, the ground beneath feet. The fall = a structural failure of choice: grasping rather than receiving. Aph [1]: &quot;Love is that which enables choice&quot; — but choice was misused. Not a failure of love but a failure to trust the sufficiency already given.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Second Garden: Gethsemane (<em>Gath Shemen</em>)</h2>
<p><strong>Matt 26:36-46 · Luke 22:39-46 · John 18:1-11</strong></p>
<h3>The Space</h3>
<p><em>Gethsemane</em> (G1068) = from Chaldee <em>gath</em> (H1660, wine-press) + <em>shemen</em> (H8081, oil). Literally: <strong>the oil press</strong>. The place where olives are crushed to yield oil.</p>
<p>John 18:1 calls it a <em>kepos</em> (G2779) — a garden. The same word he will use for the tomb-garden (19:41). The second garden is a garden that is also a press.</p>
<h3>The Act</h3>
<p>The anti-Eden. In the first garden, the human grasped. In this garden, the God-man releases: <strong>&quot;Not my will, but thine, be done&quot;</strong> (Luke 22:42). The exact inversion of <em>harpagmos</em>. Where Adam clutched, Christ unclenched.</p>
<p>Luke alone records the <em>agonia</em> (G74) — from <em>agon</em> (contest, arena). This is not passive sadness but active struggle. And: &quot;his sweat was as it were great drops of blood <strong>falling down to the ground</strong> (<em>ge</em>).&quot; The second Adam&#39;s blood falls to the earth (<em>ge</em>/<em>adamah</em>) that the first Adam&#39;s sin cursed. The ground receives what it lost.</p>
<h3>The Words</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Watch with me&quot;</strong> (Matt 26:38) — <em>Gregoreo</em>: stay awake. The disciples fail where Adam failed: remaining present. In Eden, Adam was present but passive (he &quot;was with her,&quot; Gen 3:6). In Gethsemane, the disciples are present but sleeping. The same failure of <em>hypomone</em> — the inability to remain-under.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;If it be possible, let this cup pass&quot;</strong> — The cup = the pressing. He asks for the press to be removed, then submits to it. This is not resignation but effective choice at its most costly: seeing the alternative clearly and choosing the harder path with full knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?&quot;</strong> (John 18:11) — The word shifts: the cup is not imposed but <em>given</em>. A gift. The pressing is a gift.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Pressing and the Anointing</h3>
<p><em>Shemen</em> (oil) is the substance of <em>mishchah</em> (anointing, H4888), from <em>mashach</em> (H4886, to anoint), from which <em>mashiach</em> (H4899, Messiah) derives. The Messiah — the Anointed One — is pressed in the place of oil-pressing. <strong>The crushing produces the anointing.</strong> Gethsemane is where the Messiah becomes, in suffering, what his name already declared. The olive must be crushed for the oil to flow; the Anointed must be pressed for the anointing to reach others.</p>
<p>This is the kenotic pattern (<em>kenoo</em>, Phil 2:7) at its most concrete: self-emptying AS the ground of gift.</p>
<h3>IM Parallel</h3>
<p>Gethsemane = the omniscient modality: relational agony. &quot;Watch WITH me&quot; — the suffering is in the between-space. He is alone because his companions sleep. The isolation is relational, not spatial. Aph [42]: &quot;Healing, growth, and evolution always happens &#39;between&#39;&quot; — but here the between-space is empty. The disciples cannot hold it. And yet: &quot;There appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him&quot; (Luke 22:43). The between is not entirely abandoned.</p>
<p>Aph [9]: &quot;Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.&quot; Gethsemane is pure asymmetry: he gives everything; they sleep. Continuity is maintained solely from one side. This IS love, by the IM&#39;s own definition.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The Third Garden: The Tomb (<em>Kepos</em>)</h2>
<p><strong>John 19:41, 20:1-18 · Synthesis 19</strong></p>
<h3>The Space</h3>
<p>&quot;Now in the place where he was crucified there was a <strong>garden</strong> (<em>kepos</em>); and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid&quot; (John 19:41). The same <em>kepos</em> as Gethsemane (John 18:1). The arrest-garden and the burial-garden are linguistically one.</p>
<p>The cross stands in a garden. The <em>stauros</em> (G4716, from <em>histemi</em> — Synthesis 24) is planted in the <em>kepos</em> like a tree. The <em>xulon</em> (G3586 — &quot;tree/wood,&quot; used for the cross in Acts 5:30, 10:39, 1 Pet 2:24) stands where the <em>ets</em> (H6086, tree) once stood.</p>
<h3>The Act</h3>
<p>The <em>kaine ktisis</em> resurrection. Already studied in detail (Synthesis 19). The critical garden-moments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mary mistakes him for the <em>kepouros</em></strong> (G2780, gardener) — John 20:15. Theologically precise. The new Adam stands in the new garden. The <em>kepouros</em> tends the garden; the risen Christ tends creation. Mary&#39;s &quot;mistake&quot; is the deepest truth.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Mary.&quot;</strong> — One word. Recognition by <em>phone</em> (voice), not sight. The gardener speaks a name and the world re-forms. In Eden, Adam named the animals; here the new Adam names the person. Naming as creation.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Touch me not&quot;</strong> (<em>haptomai</em>, G680) — &quot;Stop clinging.&quot; The old-creation hands cannot hold the new-creation body. The relationship is not lost but must be transformed. Not <em>ekluo</em> (dissolution) but <em>metamorphoo</em> (transformation).</li>
<li><em><strong>Emphysao</strong></em> (G1720) — &quot;He breathed on them&quot; (John 20:22). The same verb as Gen 2:7 LXX: God breathed into Adam&#39;s nostrils the breath of life. The first breath made a living creature; this breath gives the Holy Spirit. The most immanent act (breath, face-to-face) carries the most transcendent gift.</li>
<li><em><strong>Soudarion</strong></em> folded — The face-cloth of death set aside, not discarded. The <em>kalumma</em> (veil) permanently removed. The anti-<em>kalumma</em> (Synthesis 16): the risen face is unveiled forever.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The <em>Xulon</em> Thread</h3>
<p>This is where the tree-thread converges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gen 2-3:</strong> <em>Ets ha-chayyim</em> (tree of life) accessible, then <em>shamar</em>-ed. <em>Ets ha-da&#39;at</em> (tree of knowledge) consumed, producing death.</li>
<li><strong>The Cross:</strong> <em>Xulon</em> (Acts 5:30) — &quot;whom ye slew and hanged on a <em>tree</em>.&quot; The tree of death. The <em>ets</em> that bore forbidden fruit now bears the Innocent. The tree of knowledge killed; the tree of the cross heals.</li>
<li><strong>Rev 22:2:</strong> <em>Xulon zoes</em> — tree of life, returned. The same tree, or its final form.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IM Parallel</h3>
<p>The Tomb-garden = the transcendent modality: beyond death, beyond the old categories. The risen body is continuous but discontinuous (same wounds, new form — passes through doors, won&#39;t die). This exceeds what the IM can structurally account for: <em>kaine ktisis</em> (categorical newness) is not repair of the old but something the old never contained. Yet the continuity (same person, same scars) IS the IM&#39;s principle: love known by its continuity.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Fourth Garden: The City (<em>Polis</em> with <em>Xulon Zoes</em>)</h2>
<p><strong>Revelation 21-22</strong></p>
<h3>The Space</h3>
<p>Not a garden but a garden-city: &quot;the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&quot; (Rev 21:2). The <em>gan</em> (fenced enclosure) has become a <em>polis</em> (city) — but with garden features: a river, a tree, fruit, healing leaves.</p>
<p>The city descends. It does not grow from below; it comes from above. <em>Kainos</em> (G2537) = new in quality and freshness (not <em>neos</em>, new in time). The same <em>kainos</em> as <em>kaine ktisis</em> (2 Cor 5:17). This is not a replacement but a transfiguration.</p>
<h3>The Reversals</h3>
<p>Every curse of Gen 3 is explicitly undone:</p>

</tbody></table></div>
<h3>The Key Words</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Xulon zoes</strong></em> (G3586 + G2222) — &quot;The tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month&quot; (22:2). The barred tree of Gen 3:24 now yields monthly. Not one fruit but twelve. Not seasonal but perpetual. This is surplus beyond anything Eden contained. Eden&#39;s tree of life was sufficient; the city&#39;s tree is superabundant.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The leaves of the tree for the <em>therapeuo</em> of the nations&quot;</strong> (22:2) — <em>Therapeuo</em> = to heal by attending/serving (also: to worship). The tree heals AND the tree serves. The <em>rapha</em> (H7495, heal by stitching — Synthesis 20) reaches its cosmic form: nations stitched together.</li>
<li><em><strong>Potamos</strong></em> (G4215) — &quot;a pure river of water of life&quot; (22:1). Eden had a river flowing out in four directions (Gen 2:10); this river flows from the throne. The source is no longer hidden; the river&#39;s origin is visible.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;No temple therein&quot;</strong> (21:22) — &quot;The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb ARE the temple.&quot; The gap between sacred space and ordinary space is dissolved. The immanent-transcendent distinction collapses: God&#39;s presence IS the space. No modality mediates; all are simultaneously present.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;No night there&quot;</strong> (22:5) — The seventh day&#39;s open-endedness (Gen 2:2-3, no &quot;evening and morning&quot; — Synthesis 14) reaches its fulfillment. The <em>olam</em> (concealed/everlasting) is revealed. What was hidden (the endless day) is now manifest.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The gates shall not be shut at all&quot;</strong> (21:25) — The <em>shamar</em>-ed way (Gen 3:24) permanently open. The cherubim who guarded now welcome. The enclosure becomes the opening. The <em>gan</em> (fenced) becomes the city with gates that never close.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Behold, I make all things <em>kainos</em>&quot;</strong> (21:5) — Not &quot;I make all new things&quot; but &quot;I make all things new.&quot; The old is not replaced but renewed. Continuity with radical transformation. Same <em>kainos</em> as <em>kaine ktisis</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Final Invitation</h3>
<p>&quot;The Spirit and the bride say, <strong>Come</strong>. And let him that heareth say, <strong>Come</strong>. And let him that is athirst <strong>come</strong>. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life <strong>freely</strong>&quot; (22:17).</p>
<p>The last word of the Bible&#39;s narrative arc is <strong>invitation</strong>. Not exclusion (Eden&#39;s <em>shamar</em>), not pressing (Gethsemane&#39;s <em>gath</em>), not even surprise (the Tomb&#39;s recognition) — but open, universal, free invitation. &quot;Whosoever will&quot; = Aph [1]: &quot;Love is that which enables choice.&quot; The final garden enables choice absolutely.</p>

<h2>VI. The Deep Structure</h2>
<h3>A. From Enclosure to Openness</h3>
<p>Eden is <em>gan</em> — fenced. After the fall, it is <em>shamar</em>-ed — hedged with thorns (the root of <em>shamar</em>). Gethsemane is entered voluntarily — Jesus goes TO the place of pressing. The Tomb is opened — the stone rolled away. The City&#39;s gates never close. The arc bends from sealed enclosure to permanent openness.</p>
<p><strong>IM parallel:</strong> The three modalities (immanent/omniscient/transcendent) are distinguished by their boundaries. In Eden, the boundaries are violated (eating from the wrong tree). In Gethsemane, the boundaries are accepted (&quot;thy will, not mine&quot;). In the Tomb, the boundaries are transcended (doors don&#39;t stop the risen body). In the City, the boundaries are dissolved — no temple, no night, no gate closed.</p>
<h3>B. The <em>Xulon</em> Thread</h3>
<p>The tree moves from prohibition (Gen 2:17: &quot;thou shalt not eat&quot;) through death (Acts 5:30: &quot;hanged on a tree&quot;) through absence (the empty tomb has no tree — the tree was the cross, and he is risen from it) to superabundance (Rev 22:2: twelve fruits, monthly, healing leaves).</p>
<p>The tree of knowledge killed by being consumed. The tree of the cross kills the one hung upon it. The tree of life heals by being freely offered. <strong>The same structure — tree and human — moves from taking to being taken to giving.</strong></p>
<h3>C. The Ground</h3>
<p>In Eden: <em>adamah</em> (ground) receives a curse because of <em>adam</em> (man). In Gethsemane: the ground receives the blood-sweat of the second Adam. In the Tomb: the ground (the stone slab) holds then releases the body. In the City: the ground is &quot;pure gold, as it were transparent glass&quot; (21:21) — the cursed ground transfigured into transparency.</p>
<p><strong>The ground is the same ground.</strong> What was cursed is not replaced but redeemed. Continuity: the same <em>adamah</em>, transformed.</p>
<h3>D. The Pressing as Pivot</h3>
<p>Gethsemane is the pivot of the entire arc. Without the pressing, the oil does not flow. Without &quot;not my will but thine,&quot; the <em>harpagmos</em> of Eden is never answered. The pressing-garden stands between the pleasure-garden and the resurrection-garden as the necessary passage.</p>
<p><strong>IM parallel:</strong> The IM describes the &quot;ground&quot; as the space between modalities — the gap from which all distinction arises. Gethsemane IS that gap, made flesh. The space between the old creation and the new, between the first Adam and the last, between the closed garden and the open city. The pressing happens in the between.</p>
<p>Aph [110]: &quot;There is no glory in suffering.&quot; Gethsemane does not glorify suffering. It reveals that the passage through suffering — freely chosen — produces what no other path can. The oil flows only through the press. This is not a celebration of the press but a recognition that the <em>shemen</em> (anointing) requires the <em>gath</em> (pressing).</p>

<h2>VII. Key Insights — Session 34</h2>
<ol start="277">
<li><p><strong>Gethsemane = <em>gath shemen</em> = oil press.</strong> The crushing produces the anointing. <em>Shemen</em> (oil) → <em>mashach</em> (anoint) → <em>mashiach</em> (Messiah). The Anointed is pressed in the place of pressing into being what his name declares.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gethsemane is the anti-Eden.</strong> Same structure (a garden, a choice, a tree-related consequence), opposite act: grasping (<em>harpagmos</em>) → releasing (&quot;not my will&quot;). The mirror is exact.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Blood to the ground reverses the curse.</strong> In Eden, <em>adamah</em> is cursed for <em>adam</em>&#39;s sake. In Gethsemane, the second Adam&#39;s blood falls to the <em>ge</em> (ground). The cursed ground receives the blood of the un-cursing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The disciples&#39; sleep mirrors Adam&#39;s passivity.</strong> &quot;Could ye not watch with me?&quot; — The failure of <em>hypomone</em> (remaining-under) repeats across gardens. Adam &quot;was with her&quot; but did not act; the disciples are with him but cannot stay awake. Presence without engagement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>John&#39;s two gardens are one <em>kepos</em>.</strong> The arrest-garden (18:1) and the tomb-garden (19:41) use the same word. The pressing and the rising happen in the same space. Gethsemane and Easter are linguistically continuous.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The <em>xulon</em> thread: taking → being taken → giving.</strong> Tree of knowledge (consumed, killing). Tree of the cross (<em>xulon</em>, Acts — killed upon). Tree of life (offered, healing). Same <em>ets</em>/<em>xulon</em>, three modes. The tree&#39;s meaning transforms as the gardens transform.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Every curse of Gen 3 is explicitly reversed in Rev 21-22.</strong> Cursed ground → no curse. Thorns → healing leaves. Death → no death. Pain → no pain. Exile → dwelling-with. <em>Shamar</em>-ed gate → gates never shut. Skins → bride-glory. The reversal is point-by-point, not general.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The <em>shamar</em>-ed way IS the way walked.</strong> Gen 3:24 guards (<em>shamar</em>) the way; it does not destroy it. The path through the four gardens IS the guarded way being walked. <em>Shamar</em> = to preserve, attend, protect. The way was always being kept <em>for</em> someone who would walk it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;No temple therein&quot; = all three modalities unified.</strong> God and the Lamb ARE the temple. The distinction between sacred and secular, transcendent and immanent, collapses. The City is the IM&#39;s dream — all modalities co-present — but personal.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The final word is &quot;Come.&quot;</strong> Not exclusion, not requirement, not structural test. Invitation. &quot;Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&quot; The IM says love enables choice (Aph [1]); the last garden enacts it: the choosing is enabled by the invitation, and the invitation has no end.</p>
</li>

<p><em>The study began in a garden and ends in a garden-city. The gate that was sealed is open. The tree that was forbidden bears twelve fruits. The river that was hidden flows from the throne. The ground that was cursed is transparent gold. And the voice that asked &quot;Where art thou?&quot; now says &quot;Come.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The IM gives the language: continuity, choice, the gap between modalities. Scripture gives the Person: the one who walked from garden to garden, choosing the press, rising in the tomb, opening the gate.</em></p>
<p><em>Neither is sufficient alone. Together they illuminate what neither sees separately.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.&quot; — Revelation 22:17</em></p>
