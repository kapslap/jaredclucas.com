<p><strong>The river does not change. Our relation to its source does.</strong> In Eden, the source is hidden and the river scatters. In Ezekiel, the source is the temple and the river deepens. In Revelation, the source is the throne and the river flows openly through all things.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Four Depths (Ezek 47:3-5)</h2>
<p>The man with the measuring line leads Ezekiel through four stages, each a thousand cubits deeper:</p>
<h3>1. Ankles — <em>Ephes</em> (H657)</h3>
<p>&quot;The waters were to the <em>ephes</em>&quot; — <em>ephes</em> means both &quot;ankle&quot; (extremity of the leg) AND &quot;cessation/end.&quot; The first depth is AT THE EXTREMITY. The river begins where things end. One can still stand, still walk, still control one&#39;s path. The feet touch bottom.</p>
<h3>2. Knees — <em>Birkaim</em> (dual of <em>berek</em>, H1290)</h3>
<p>&quot;The waters were to the knees.&quot; The knees = the posture of bending, prayer, submission. <em>Berek</em> is also connected to <em>barak</em> (to bless/kneel). At knee-depth, the body must adjust — one cannot stride freely but must labor against resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Connection to Gethsemane:</strong> Luke 22:41 — &quot;he kneeled down (<em>tithemi ta gonata</em>) and prayed.&quot; The second depth = the Gethsemane posture. Knee-deep in the river of what is coming. Bending, submitting, pressing through.</p>
<h3>3. Loins — <em>Mothen</em> (H4975)</h3>
<p>&quot;The waters were to the <em>mothen</em>&quot; — the loins, the center of the body, seat of strength and generation. Half the body submerged. The transition between standing and being carried. The liminal depth.</p>
<h3>4. Swimming — <em>Sachah</em> (H7811)</h3>
<p>&quot;Waters to swim in (<em>sachah</em>), a river that could not be passed over (<em>abar</em>).&quot; At the fourth depth, the prophet loses his footing entirely. He cannot cross the river by his own strength. The river is beyond <em>abar</em> — beyond crossing, beyond human passage.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Son of man, hast thou SEEN this?&quot;</strong> (v.6) — The question comes AFTER the fourth depth. Only after losing control does the seeing begin. The omniscient moment follows the loss of immanent standing.</p>

<h2>III. The Healing (vv. 8-12)</h2>
<h3>The Dead Sea Healed</h3>
<p>&quot;These waters... go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be <em>rapha</em>-ed.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Rapha</em> (H7495) = to heal by stitching (Synthesis 20). The Dead Sea = <em>yam ha-melach</em> (salt sea) = the lowest point on earth = the place where nothing lives. It is the aquatic valley of dry bones — water that has died. Too much salt, too much accumulation, no outflow.</p>
<p>The temple-river heals the dead water just as the <em>ruach</em> revived the dry bones (Ezek 37). Same book, same pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ezek 37:</strong> Dry bones → <em>ruach</em> breathes → army lives (<em>chayah</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Ezek 47:</strong> Dead sea → temple waters flow → &quot;everything shall live (<em>chayah</em>) whither the river cometh&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Same verb: <em>chayah</em> (H2421). The resurrection-word. What the breath did for bones, the water does for the sea. Two modes of the same gift.</p>
<h3>The Trees (v.12)</h3>
<p>&quot;By the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for <em>teruphah</em> (H8644, medicine/remedy).&quot;</p>
<p>This is Revelation 22:2 in embryonic form:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Ezekiel 47:12</th>
<th>Revelation 22:2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>&quot;All trees&quot; (many)</td>
<td>&quot;The tree of life&quot; (one/unified)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&quot;New fruit according to his months&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Twelve manner of fruits... every month&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&quot;Leaf for <em>teruphah</em>&quot; (medicine)</td>
<td>&quot;Leaves for <em>therapeuo</em>&quot; (healing of nations)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trees on &quot;this side and that side&quot;</td>
<td>Tree &quot;on either side of the river&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Source: &quot;issued out of the sanctuary&quot;</td>
<td>Source: &quot;out of the throne of God and of the Lamb&quot;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The progression: many trees → one tree. Medicine for individuals → healing of nations. Sanctuary → throne. Ezekiel sees the model; Revelation sees the completion. The surplus: not just trees but THE tree; not just medicine but cosmic healing.</p>
<h3>The Marsh (v.11)</h3>
<p>&quot;But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.&quot;</p>
<p>The river has an edge. Not all is healed. The marshes — the places that receive the water but retain their stagnation — remain salt. This is the persistent exterior, the boundary of the river&#39;s reach.</p>
<p><strong>IM parallel:</strong> The IM insists that distinction requires boundary. For the river to be meaningful, there must be a place it does not flow. For healing to be real, non-healing must be possible. This is the structural condition of choice: love enables but does not compel.</p>
<p><strong>Scriptural parallel:</strong> Rev 21:8 — &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth.&quot; The marsh of Ezekiel = the lake of Revelation. The exterior persists. The invitation (&quot;Come,&quot; Rev 22:17) is genuine precisely because refusal is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Divergence point:</strong> Does the IM allow permanent non-healing? The IM&#39;s fundamental relational structure might suggest total disconnection is impossible — all things are related by virtue of existence. But Ezekiel&#39;s marsh and Revelation&#39;s lake suggest otherwise: persistent exteriority, places the healing river does not reach. Scripture allows for permanent loss. This is not punishment but the consequence of refusing the river — the marsh is not attacked but simply <em>not healed</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Threshold (<em>Miphthan</em>) Connection</h2>
<p>The waters issue &quot;from under the <em>miphthan</em> (H4670, threshold) of the house.&quot; The threshold is the liminal space — the place of entrance, the boundary between inside and outside.</p>
<p><em>Miphthan</em> derives from roots connected to stretching/turning. The threshold is where one turns to enter. The healing river begins at the place of turning — the decision-point.</p>
<p><strong>Connection to John 19:34:</strong> &quot;One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out <em>blood and water</em>.&quot; Jesus called his body &quot;this temple&quot; (John 2:21). The temple&#39;s threshold produces water (Ezek 47:1); the temple of Christ&#39;s body, pierced, produces water and blood. The river from the wounded temple.</p>
<p>The threshold → the side → the throne. Three sources of the same water:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ezekiel: <em>miphthan</em> (threshold of the temple)</li>
<li>John: pierced <em>pleuran</em> (side of the body-temple)</li>
<li>Revelation: <em>thronos</em> (throne of God and the Lamb)</li>
</ol>
<p>The wound is the threshold. The threshold is the source of healing.</p>

<h3>Synthesis Connections</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>#15 Valley of Bones:</strong> <em>Chayah</em> in both. Breath revives bones; water revives the sea. Same verb, two media.</li>
<li><strong>#20 Suffering Servant:</strong> <em>Rapha</em> (heal by stitching) in both. The servant&#39;s wounds heal; the river&#39;s flow heals.</li>
<li><strong>#25 Four Gardens:</strong> The river arc = the garden arc. Four depths = four gardens. Threshold = Gethsemane (the turning-point).</li>
<li><strong>#24 Race &amp; Mountains:</strong> &quot;Son of man, hast thou SEEN this?&quot; = the omniscient question. Sight follows surrender.</li>
<li><strong>#13 Cosmic Christ:</strong> The river from the side (John 19:34) = <em>synistao</em> liquefied. The coherence-sustainer&#39;s wound produces the healing flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VI. Key Insights — Session 36</h2>
<ol start="294">
<li><p><strong><em>Ephes</em> (H657) = ankle AND cessation/end.</strong> The river begins at the extremity, at the place where things end. The first depth IS the end — and from the end, the river deepens.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The four depths = four postures: standing → kneeling → half-submerged → carried.</strong> Control yields to surrender in four stages. The prophet loses footing at the fourth depth. Human navigation fails where the river is deepest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gethsemane IS the knee-depth.</strong> Luke 22:41: &quot;he kneeled down.&quot; The second stage of the river = the Gethsemane posture. Knee-deep in what is coming, bending, pressing through resistance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Dead Sea = the aquatic valley of dry bones.</strong> Water that has died (too much salt, no outflow). The temple-river heals it with <em>rapha</em> (stitching); the same verb used for the servant&#39;s healing (Isa 53:5). Same book, same pattern: Ezek 37 (breath → bones) and Ezek 47 (water → dead sea).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Chayah</em> unifies Ezek 37 and 47.</strong> &quot;Can these bones <em>live</em>?&quot; and &quot;everything shall <em>live</em> whither the river cometh&quot; — same verb. Breath for the dry, water for the dead. Two modes of one gift.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ezek 47:12 = Rev 22:2 in embryonic form.</strong> Many trees → the tree of life. Monthly fruit → twelve fruits. <em>Teruphah</em> (medicine) → <em>therapeuo</em> (healing of nations). Sanctuary → throne. The surplus: not just remedy but cosmic restoration.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The marsh persists (v.11).</strong> Not all is healed. The miry places are &quot;given to salt.&quot; The river has an edge. Love enables choice (Aph [1]); the marsh = the possibility of refusal. The invitation is genuine because it can be declined.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The threshold (<em>miphthan</em>) → the pierced side → the throne.</strong> Three sources of the same water: Ezek 47 (temple threshold), John 19:34 (Christ&#39;s wounded side), Rev 22:1 (the throne). The wound IS the threshold. The temple-body produces healing from its wound.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Son of man, hast thou SEEN this?&quot; — sight follows surrender.</strong> The omniscient question comes AFTER the fourth depth, after the prophet can no longer stand. Seeing begins where control ends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The river makes its own valley (<em>nachal</em> = stream AND valley).</strong> The water carves the landscape it flows through. Like <em>archegos</em> (the pioneer who creates the path by walking it), the river creates its own course. The healing is not delivered to a pre-existing channel; it carves the channel as it flows.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;Everything shall live whither the river cometh.&quot; — Ezekiel 47:9</em></p>
<p><em>From a trickle at the threshold to an uncrossable depth. From the extremity (<em>ephes</em>) to the overwhelming. The river begins where things end — and everything it touches lives.</em></p>
