<hr>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Veil and the Mirror (Immanent Modality — Interaction)</h2>
<h3>Key Greek</h3>
<p><strong>Kalumma</strong> (G2571) — &quot;veil&quot; — from <em>kalupto</em> (G2572) = &quot;to cover up, hide.&quot; Remarkably, <em>kalupto</em> is <strong>akin to <em>klepto</em> (steal) and <em>krupto</em> (hide/secret).</strong> The veil is linguistically related to both hiding and stealing. It <em>steals sight</em>. Cf. <em>kruptos</em> (G2927) in Matt 6:6 (secret prayer, Synthesis 8) — there, hiddenness is positive (intimacy with God); here, the veil is obstruction. Same linguistic family, opposite valence. Sacred hiddenness vs. obstructive veiling.</p>
<p><strong>Katoptrizomai</strong> (G2734) — &quot;beholding as in a glass/mirror&quot; — middle voice: to mirror oneself, to see reflected. Not direct vision but <strong>mediated</strong> vision. We see the glory <em>reflected</em> — as in a mirror. This is the immanent position: the relational between, interaction itself. Not the transcendent (direct encounter would destroy, as Moses discovered) but the mediated, interactive seeing. The mirror is the space-between — and the between IS the immanent modality (Axiom I, origin/middle).</p>
<p><strong>Metamorphoo</strong> (G3339) — &quot;changed, transformed&quot; — from <em>meta</em> (beyond) + <em>morphoo</em> (G3445, to fashion/form), from the same root as <strong>morphe</strong> (G3444) in Phil 2:6. THE CONNECTION: Phil 2 says Christ had <em>morphe theou</em> (form of God) and took <em>morphe doulou</em> (form of servant). 2 Cor 3:18 says we are <em>metamorphoumetha</em> — being re-formed, trans-formed. <strong>The same word-family links kenosis and transformation.</strong> The <em>morphe</em> Christ emptied himself of is the <em>morphe</em> we are being transformed into. His descent enables our ascent. His emptying fills our forming.</p>
<p><strong>Eikon</strong> (G1504) — &quot;image&quot; — same word from Col 1:15 (<em>eikon tou theou tou aoratou</em>, Synthesis 13). In 3:18: &quot;changed into the same <em>eikon</em>.&quot; We become the image we behold. In 4:4: Christ is &quot;the <em>eikon</em> of God.&quot; The trajectory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Veil → turning (v.16) → unveiled face → mirror-beholding → transformation into <em>eikon</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We become what we behold.</strong> This is the ICT operating relationally: the comparison (<em>parabole</em>, Synthesis 10) transforms the one who compares. The act of seeing changes the seer into what is seen. The immanent modality — interaction itself — doesn&#39;t merely observe; it transforms. And as the most fundamental modality, this transformative interaction IS the deepest act.</p>
<p><strong>Doxa</strong> (G1391) — &quot;glory&quot; — from <em>dokeo</em> (to appear/seem) — literally &quot;that which appears, what is very apparent.&quot; Appears 12 times in chapter 3 alone. The escalating chain: Moses&#39; glory → veiled glory → ministry of Spirit&#39;s glory → glory that surpasses → &quot;from glory to glory&quot; (v.18). Each glory supersedes the previous. This is the surplus pattern: not replacement but surpassing. Cf. <em>hyperupsoo</em> (Phil 2:9) — glory doesn&#39;t erase the prior glory; it exceeds it.</p>
<p><strong>Eleutheria</strong> (G1657) — &quot;liberty/freedom&quot; — &quot;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <em>eleutheria</em>&quot; (3:17). The unveiled face = freedom. <strong>Aphorism [1]: &quot;Love is that which enables choice.&quot;</strong> The veil restricts; its removal enables. Spirit = freedom = love = choice. The sequence is: Spirit present → veil gone → face open → freedom → transformation.</p>
<h3>The Pattern of 3:18</h3>
<p>This single verse contains the entire immanent modality (interaction):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We all, with <strong>open face</strong> beholding as in a <strong>glass</strong> the <strong>glory</strong> of the Lord, are <strong>changed</strong> into the same <strong>image</strong> from <strong>glory to glory</strong>, even as by the <strong>Spirit</strong> of the Lord.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open face</strong> (<em>anakalupto</em> = unveiled) — the precondition: obstruction removed</li>
<li><strong>Glass/mirror</strong> (<em>katoptrizomai</em>) — the medium: relational, reflected, between</li>
<li><strong>Glory</strong> (<em>doxa</em>) — the content: what appears, what shines</li>
<li><strong>Changed</strong> (<em>metamorphoo</em>) — the process: gradual re-forming</li>
<li><strong>Image</strong> (<em>eikon</em>) — the destination: what Christ already is</li>
<li><strong>Glory to glory</strong> (<em>apo doxes eis doxan</em>) — the trajectory: escalating, surplus</li>
<li><strong>Spirit</strong> (<em>pneuma</em>) — the agent: the same <em>ruach</em> that brooded over the waters</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 4: Treasure in Earthen Vessels (Omniscient Modality — Existence)</h2>
<h3>4:6 — Creation Re-enacted</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul explicitly links <strong>Genesis 1:3</strong> (creation of light) to the illumination of the human heart. The same creative act that originated the cosmos is re-enacted in every turning. This confirms Synthesis 14 (Genesis Return): the beginning is not merely historical but perpetually present. &quot;Let there be light&quot; is spoken again — this time inside.</p>
<p><strong>The face of Jesus Christ</strong> = the <em>eikon</em> through which the <em>doxa</em> shines. The immanent mediator (Christ as interaction/between) makes the transcendent glory available to the omniscient domain (factual existence, the heart that EXISTS). The mirror of ch.3 becomes concrete here: Christ&#39;s face IS the mirror in which we see God&#39;s glory.</p>
<h3>4:7 — Ostrakinos Skeuos (Earthen Vessels)</h3>
<p><strong>Ostrakinos</strong> (G3749) — &quot;earthen, of clay&quot; — from <em>ostrakon</em> (a tile, a potsherd). The word connotes fragility, commonness, expendability. &quot;We have this treasure (<em>thesauros</em>) in earthen vessels (<em>ostrakinos skeuos</em>).&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>ostrakinos skeuos</em> is the kenotic form. God&#39;s glory <strong>chooses to inhabit</strong> breakable human flesh. This echoes Phil 2: the <em>morphe theou</em> choosing <em>morphe doulou</em>. The container is frail; the content is infinite. <strong>&quot;That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.&quot;</strong> The fragility is not a defect — it is the point. The breakable vessel reveals that the power comes from elsewhere. Kenosis as epistemology: weakness discloses the source.</p>
<p>Cf. Aphorism [80]: &quot;Creativity does not happen somewhere or to someone; rather it is inherently everywhere and within everyone.&quot; The treasure is <em>in</em> the vessel — not imported but indwelling. Yet Paul insists the power is &quot;of God, not of us.&quot; The IM says creativity is inherent; Paul says the source is personal. Same structure, different ground. The persistent divergence.</p>
<h3>4:10-12 — The Kenotic Life</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Always bearing about in the body the dying (<em>nekrosis</em>) of the Lord Jesus, that the life (<em>zoe</em>) also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Nekrosis</em> = deadness, death-process. Not a single event but a continuous bearing. The kenotic pattern is not a one-time descent but a <strong>daily practice</strong> — dying working in us so that life works in others. &quot;Death worketh in us, but life in you&quot; (v.12). The surplus of kenosis: our emptying fills others. The zero-point of personal kenosis becomes the source-point for another&#39;s life.</p>
<h3>4:16-18 — The Unseen Eternal</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The things which are seen are temporal (<em>proskairos</em>); the things which are not seen are eternal (<em>aionios</em>).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hiddenness theme (Syntheses 8, 10, 11) returns: what is real is hidden; what appears is passing. <em>Proskairos</em> = for a season, temporary. <em>Aionios</em> = pertaining to the age, eternal. The visible decays; the invisible grows. This is the <em>olam</em> principle (Ps 139:24, Ezek 37:26) — the concealed way that is also the everlasting way.</p>
<p>And 4:17: &quot;Our light affliction (<em>elaphros thlipsis</em>), which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal <strong>weight</strong> (<em>baros</em>) of glory.&quot; The word for <strong>weight</strong> echoes Hebrew <em>kabod</em> (H3519, Session 18, insight #152) — glory = weight = significance. Paul is playing the same register: light affliction → heavy glory. The kenotic exchange reappears as a physics of glory: lightness transforms into weight, momentary into eternal.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 5: New Creation and Reconciliation (Transcendent Modality — Creation)</h2>
<h3>5:1-4 — Clothed Upon, Not Unclothed</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not for that we would be unclothed, but <strong>clothed upon</strong>, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is crucial. The eschatological hope is <strong>not escape from embodiment</strong> but more embodiment — not stripped naked but layered-over. Not the soul fleeing the body but the body receiving additional clothing. The surplus pattern: not removal but addition. Not <em>kenoo</em> (emptying) but <em>ependuomai</em> (to clothe upon — from <em>epi</em> + <em>enduo</em> = to put on over). Mortality is not destroyed but <strong>swallowed up</strong> (<em>katapino</em>) — consumed by something larger. Factual existence (omniscient) is not discarded but enveloped by the creative (transcendent).</p>
<p>Cf. Ezekiel 37 (Synthesis 15): the bones are not abandoned but rebuilt and <em>then</em> breathed into. The form is not destroyed but transformed. Restoration is not subtraction but addition.</p>
<h3>5:14 — Synecho: Love as Coherent Constraint</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The love of Christ <strong>constraineth</strong> (<em>synechei</em>) us.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Synecho</strong> (G4912) — &quot;to hold together, compress, constrain, arrest.&quot; From <em>syn</em> (together) + <em>echo</em> (to hold). Literally: &quot;holds-together.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>This is the semantic cousin of <em>synistao</em></strong> (G4921, Col 1:17, Synthesis 13) — both are <em>syn-</em> compounds meaning &quot;to hold together.&quot; The connection:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Word</th>
<th>Reference</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Domain</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><em>Synistao</em></td>
<td>Col 1:17</td>
<td>&quot;all things consist/hold together&quot;</td>
<td>Cosmological coherence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Synecho</em></td>
<td>2 Cor 5:14</td>
<td>&quot;the love of Christ constrains&quot;</td>
<td>Experiential constraint</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>The same love that holds the cosmos together (Col 1:17) holds the believer together (2 Cor 5:14).</strong> <em>Synistao</em> is coherence seen from outside — the structure holds. <em>Synecho</em> is coherence felt from inside — the love compresses, constrains, won&#39;t let go. The IM&#39;s continuity-as-structural-coherence, but <strong>experienced as personal pressure</strong>. Love as coherence felt from within feels like constraint. It is not freedom FROM but freedom FOR — love constrains us toward others rather than toward self.</p>
<h3>5:17 — Kaine Ktisis (New Creation)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If any man be in Christ, he is a <em>kaine ktisis</em>: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kainos</strong> (G2537) — &quot;new in freshness/quality&quot; (not <em>neos</em> = new in time). <strong>Ktisis</strong> (G2937) — &quot;original formation, creation.&quot; <em>Kaine ktisis</em> = a <strong>fresh original formation</strong>. Not repair. Not restoration. Not surplus. <strong>Categorically new.</strong></p>
<p>This goes beyond <em>hyperupsoo</em> (Phil 2:9, surplus beyond starting point) and <em>me&#39;od me&#39;od</em> (Ezek 37:10, exceeding exceedingly). Those describe <em>more of the same, amplified</em>. <em>Kaine ktisis</em> describes something that has never existed before. The new creation is not the old creation restored or amplified — it is a fresh act of <em>ktisis</em>, a new original formation.</p>
<p>And yet &quot;old things are passed away&quot; (<em>ta archaia parelthen</em>) — the old has gone. This is not mere addition; it includes genuine ending. The kenotic pattern in full: something genuinely dies, something genuinely new is born. Not evolution but resurrection.</p>
<h3>5:18-19 — The Ministry of Reconciliation</h3>
<p><strong>Katallage</strong> (G2643) — &quot;reconciliation&quot; — from <em>katallasso</em> (G2644) = &quot;to change mutually, to compound a difference.&quot; From <em>kata</em> (through) + <em>allasso</em> (to change/exchange). Reconciliation is literally <strong>&quot;a thorough change of the relation.&quot;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, <strong>not imputing their trespasses unto them.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reconciliation is formally mutual (both parties re-related) but <strong>asymmetric in initiative</strong>: God absorbs the cost. &quot;Not imputing&quot; (<em>me logizomenos</em>) — choosing not to count, not to reckon. This IS Aphorism [9]: love known by continuity, not symmetry. The offended party chooses to break the cycle of reckoning. The asymmetry is total.</p>
<h3>5:21 — The Great Exchange</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kenotic exchange in its most extreme form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sinless → made sin (<em>hamartia</em>)</li>
<li>The sinful → made righteousness (<em>dikaiosune theou</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <em>kenoo</em> (Phil 2:7) pushed to its absolute limit: not just emptying of divine prerogative but <strong>filling with the opposite of one&#39;s nature</strong>. Not merely descending but taking on what one most fundamentally is not. And the result: not merely restoration but transformation into &quot;the righteousness of God&quot; — something the recipients never were and could not be on their own. The surplus exceeds even <em>hyperupsoo</em>. One becomes what one never was.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Persistent Divergence — 2 Corinthians Edition</h2>
<p>The IM says: Transformation happens through interactive seeing (the immanent modality — interaction — mediates between transcendent and omniscient). The subject is changed by the object of contemplation. This is structural. And the immanent (interaction) is the MOST FUNDAMENTAL modality — so this transformative encounter IS the deepest act of reality.</p>
<p>Scripture says: &quot;We all, with open face beholding... are changed into the same <em>eikon</em>... by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot; The transformation is <strong>into a person</strong> (<em>eikon</em> = Christ), <strong>by a person</strong> (the Spirit), <strong>through beholding a person</strong> (the Lord). Every element is personal.</p>
<p>The IM maps the <em>how</em> of transformation (relational mediation, mirror-structure, comparison changing the comparer). Scripture locates the <em>who</em> and the <em>into-whom</em>. Together: the structure of transformation is relational; the content of transformation is personal.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Insights (Session 25)</h2>
<ol start="201">
<li><p><strong><em>Kalumma</em> (G2571) is kin to <em>klepto</em> (steal) and <em>krupto</em> (hide).</strong> The veil steals sight. But hiddenness has three faces: sacred (Matt 6:6 <em>kruptos</em>), obstructive (2 Cor 3 <em>kalumma</em>), and transcendent (2 Cor 4:18 &quot;things not seen&quot;). Same linguistic family, three valences.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Metamorphoo</em> shares the root <em>morph-</em> with Phil 2:6 <em>morphe</em>.</strong> Christ empties his <em>morphe</em>; we are <em>meta-morphoo</em>-ed into the same <em>eikon</em>. The emptying and the filling are the same word-family. His kenosis enables our formation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>3:18 contains the entire immanent modality (interaction) in one verse.</strong> Open face → mirror-beholding → glory → transformation → image → glory to glory → Spirit. The interactive act of seeing changes the seer. The ICT transforms the comparer. The immanent is MOST FUNDAMENTAL — so this verse encodes the deepest act.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>4:6 re-enacts Genesis 1:3 in the human heart.</strong> &quot;God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts.&quot; Creation is not merely historical but perpetually present. Every turning re-enacts &quot;Let there be light.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Ostrakinos</em> (earthen vessel) = the kenotic form.</strong> Fragility is not a defect but the point. The breakable container reveals that the power comes from elsewhere. Kenosis as epistemology: weakness discloses the source.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Synecho</em> (G4912, 2 Cor 5:14) is the experiential cousin of <em>synistao</em> (G4921, Col 1:17).</strong> Both are <em>syn-</em> compounds meaning &quot;hold together.&quot; One is cosmological coherence; the other is love felt as personal constraint. The same love that holds the cosmos together constrains the believer.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Kaine ktisis</em> (5:17) exceeds even <em>hyperupsoo</em> (Phil 2:9).</strong> Not surplus (more of the same, amplified) but ontological newness. Not restoration but fresh original formation. Three degrees of surplus across the study: amplification → emphatic excess → categorical newness.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Katallage</em> (reconciliation) = &quot;thorough change of relation&quot; — but asymmetric.</strong> &quot;Not imputing their trespasses&quot; — choosing not to count. Love as continuity ([9]) in its most radical form: the offended party absorbs the cost.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chapters 3-4-5 map to the three modalities (corrected).</strong> Ch.3 = IMMANENT (interactive seeing/mirror/the between). Ch.4 = OMNISCIENT (existence in embodied clay, factual suffering). Ch.5 = TRANSCENDENT (new creation, generative). The movement: interacting → existing-in-suffering → becoming-new.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Not unclothed but clothed upon&quot; (5:4).</strong> The hope is not escape from flesh but <em>more</em> embodiment. Mortality swallowed by life — not destroyed but consumed by something larger. Existence (omniscient) is not discarded but enveloped by the creative (transcendent). Restoration is addition, not subtraction.</p>
</li>
