    <h1>The Parables of the Kingdom: Matthew 13 and the IM</h1>
<h2>Study Notes — 2026-02-01 (Session 19)</h2>
<hr>
<h2>I. The Parabolic Method IS the ICT</h2>
<h3><em>Parabole</em> (G3850) and <em>Mashal</em> (H4910/4911)</h3>
<p><strong>Greek: παραβολή</strong> (<em>parabole</em>) — &quot;a similitude, i.e. (symbolic) fictitious narrative conveying a moral, apothegm or adage&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>From <strong>παραβάλλω</strong> (<em>paraballo</em>, G3846) — &quot;to throw alongside&quot;</li>
<li>A parable is literally something <em>thrown beside</em> reality — a comparison placed next to the thing it illuminates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hebrew: מָשָׁל</strong> (<em>mashal</em>, H4912) — &quot;a pithy maxim, usually of metaphorical nature; a simile, adage, poem, discourse&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>From the SAME root as <em>mashal</em> (H4910) — &quot;to rule, to have dominion&quot;</li>
<li>As noted in Session 18 (Insight #151): the capacity to <em>compare</em> and the capacity to <em>rule</em> share a root</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
The Incorrected Comparison Test (ICT) is the foundation of the entire Immanent Metaphysics — the irreducible act of comparison from which all knowing arises. Jesus&#39; teaching method — the parable — IS the ICT in narrative form. He doesn&#39;t define the kingdom; he <em>compares</em> it. &quot;The kingdom of heaven is <em>like unto</em>...&quot; Over and over: likeness, comparison, things thrown alongside.</p>
<p>Matt 13:34-35: &quot;Without a parable spake he not unto them... I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The secrets of reality are disclosed not by direct statement but by <em>comparison</em> — by placing one thing beside another and allowing the mind to perceive the relationship between them. This is what the IM describes formally: knowing begins in the act of comparing. Jesus enacts it.</p>
<p><strong>The connection to Psalm 8:</strong> Man&#39;s <em>mashal</em> (dominion) over creation is exercised through <em>mashal</em> (comparison/parable). To understand Jesus&#39; parables is to exercise the same faculty that constitutes human sovereignty — the capacity to perceive relationship, to discern likeness and difference. The ICT as both method and kingdom.</p>

<h2>II. The Sower: Four Conditions of Effective Choice</h2>
<h3>Matt 13:3-23</h3>
<p>The Sower parable describes four kinds of ground — four conditions of receptivity to the &quot;word of the kingdom&quot; (13:19). Read through the IM, these are four <em>structural conditions</em> that determine whether choice becomes effective:</p>
<h3>The Four Soils Mapped</h3>
<p><strong>1. The Wayside (13:4, 19) — No Engagement</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seed doesn&#39;t even penetrate. No <em>understanding</em> — the Greek implies no <em>reception</em>, no taking-in. The word passes over the surface.</p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> This is the self that has no attention available. Aphorism [107]: &quot;The focus and strength of choice is at a maximum where attention is at a maximum.&quot; Where there is no attention, there is no choice. The wayside self is not hostile — it is simply <em>elsewhere</em>. The word falls where there is no ground at all.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stony Ground (13:5-6, 20-21) — Engagement Without Depth</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He that received the seed into stony places... hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Root&quot; — <em>rhiza</em> (G4491):</strong> &quot;a root (literally or figuratively)&quot; — a primary word. The stony ground <em>receives</em> with joy but has no root — no depth, no continuity of self beneath the surface.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Tribulation&quot; — <em>thlipsis</em> (G2347):</strong> &quot;pressure (literally or figuratively)&quot; — from <em>thlibo</em>, to press, to compress. Tribulation is <em>pressure</em> — an external force that tests the depth of the inner structure.</p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> This is the self that engages without integration. Aphorism [67]: &quot;When the self can accept and integrate the experience of the world and remain whole (maintain a continuity and integrity of self) then one will be at peace.&quot; The stony ground receives but cannot <em>integrate</em> — it has no depth in which to root. When pressure comes (discontinuity, opposition), the surface engagement withers because there is no continuity beneath it.</p>
<p>The key phrase: <strong>&quot;hath he not root <em>in himself</em>.&quot;</strong> The root must be <em>in the self</em>, not in the circumstances. Aphorism [72]: &quot;True security is intrinsic to self; it cannot be found in any world.&quot; The stony ground seeks security in the immediate joy of reception — external validation — rather than in the depth of self.</p>
<p><strong>3. Thorns (13:7, 22) — Engagement Choked by Division</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seed grows but is <em>choked</em> — the word competes with other growths and loses. This is divided attention, divided devotion, the opposite of the <em>haplous</em> (single) eye from the Sermon study (Session 17, Insight #142).</p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> Aphorism [47]: &quot;When desires, ideas or beliefs are confused or in conflict, one has effectively become two smaller selves, each of which has significantly less freedom of choice.&quot; The thorns are competing commitments that divide the self. The IM says divided self = diminished choice. The Sermon says divided eye = darkness. Here: divided ground = no fruit.</p>
<p>Aphorism [39]: &quot;To remain attached to only one specific thing and to discard or reject all others is to suffer an obsession... The correction for obsession is not suppression, but extension.&quot; But here the problem is the reverse — attachment to <em>many things</em> (cares, riches) that choke the one thing. The correction is not adding more but <em>integration</em> — giving the word depth and priority.</p>
<p><strong>4. Good Ground (13:8, 23) — Full Engagement with Understanding</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Fruit&quot; — <em>karpos</em> (G2590):</strong> &quot;fruit (as plucked)&quot; — probably from the base of <em>harpazo</em> (to seize, to snatch). Fruit is what can be <em>gathered</em> — the visible, shareable outcome of hidden growth.</p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> The good ground is the integrated self — one with depth (root), without division (no thorns), and with sustained attention (not the wayside). The fruit is <em>creative expression</em> — the outward manifestation of inward alignment.</p>
<p>Aphorism [103]: &quot;Clear knowledge of feeling and the continued practice of effective choice (integrating all aspects of self) always results in understanding ease of life, creativity, synchronicity, and joy.&quot;</p>
<p>Note the <em>variance</em> in yield: hundredfold, sixtyfold, thirtyfold. Even among good ground, the harvest differs. The IM would say: each self&#39;s effective choice produces unique fruit in unique proportion. Aphorism [62]: &quot;There is no one right choice applicable to all individuals and in all circumstances. In each situation, there is only the unique right choice for oneself.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Four Soils as Gradient of Continuity</h3>
<p>Read through the IM&#39;s concept of continuity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wayside:</strong> No continuity at all — seed never enters ground</li>
<li><strong>Stony:</strong> Momentary continuity — sprouts but breaks at first pressure</li>
<li><strong>Thorns:</strong> Partial continuity — grows but cannot sustain through competition</li>
<li><strong>Good Ground:</strong> Full continuity — receives, roots, withstands, bears fruit</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the IM&#39;s spectrum from discontinuity (pain, loss) to continuity (joy, creativity). The four soils are four degrees of <em>the capacity for sustained connection</em> between the word and the self.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The Mustard Seed: Creativity at the Smallest Scale</h2>
<h3>Matt 13:31-32</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed... which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Mustard&quot; — <em>sinapi</em> (G4615):</strong> &quot;perhaps from (to hurt, i.e. sting)&quot; — the mustard seed is associated with pungency, sharpness, <em>intensity at small scale</em>.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [81]: &quot;All birth begins at the smallest scale of existence. All creativity begins as a single event of interaction and co-incidence at the smallest scales, everywhere at once.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [82]: &quot;Small, incremental changes — occurring everywhere at once — are always more conducive to creative expression than any suddenly-realized &#39;grand sweeping events&#39;. Large, unbounded collections of &#39;insignificant small changes&#39; can create overall effects far out of proportion to the apparent causes.&quot;</p>
<p>The mustard seed parable IS Aphorism [81-82] in narrative form. The kingdom doesn&#39;t arrive as a grand sweeping event — it begins at the smallest possible scale and grows disproportionately. The IM explains <em>why</em>: creativity begins small because the fundamental acts of creation occur at the most basic level of interaction. The kingdom&#39;s power is not despite its smallness but <em>because of</em> it.</p>
<p>Note: the grown mustard becomes a tree where &quot;the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches.&quot; The smallest seed produces the structure that shelters others. In Psalm 104, birds nesting in branches was part of the ecology of creation (104:12, 17). The mustard seed parable is a miniature creation narrative — from seed to tree to sheltering habitat. The kingdom recapitulates creation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Leaven: Hidden Transformation</h2>
<h3>Matt 13:33</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Leaven&quot; — <em>zyme</em> (G2219):</strong> &quot;ferment (as if boiling up)&quot; — from <em>zeo</em> (G2204, to boil). Leaven is <em>ferment</em> — invisible, internal, transformative.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [34]: &quot;Nothing of an emotional and spiritual nature ever occurs as a result of any goal-driven activity, technology, process or technique. The evolution of the emotional and the spiritual aspects of life only occur in the knowing and acceptance of ones own being.&quot;</p>
<p>The leaven is <em>hidden</em>. The woman <em>hides</em> it in the meal. It works invisibly, from within, without external direction. You cannot watch it happen, but it transforms the whole.</p>
<p>This maps to the IM&#39;s insistence that spiritual transformation is not goal-driven or externally imposed. It happens through hidden, internal processes — ferment, not force. The kingdom doesn&#39;t announce itself; it leavens.</p>
<p>Aphorism [65]: &quot;Joy, comfort and connectedness, although real, cannot be seen or known objectively; they must always be known subjectively as an invisible and innate aspect of self.&quot;</p>
<p>The leaven-kingdom is known by its effects (the dough rises) but the process itself is invisible — subjective, internal, hidden. This connects to Jesus&#39; teaching on secret prayer (Session 17, Insight #147): the deepest spiritual reality operates in hiddenness.</p>
<p><strong>The three measures</strong> — an unusually large amount (roughly 40 pounds of flour). A little leaven transforms an enormous batch. Again the principle of disproportionate effect from small cause — Aphorism [82].</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Hidden Treasure and the Pearl: The Reordering of Value</h2>
<h3>Matt 13:44-46</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.&quot;
&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Treasure&quot; — <em>thesauros</em> (G2344):</strong> &quot;a deposit, i.e. wealth&quot; — from <em>tithemi</em> (G5087, to place, to set). Treasure is something <em>placed</em>, deposited, stored. Not floating value but <em>located</em> value.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>These twin parables describe a <em>radical reordering of value</em>. Both men sell EVERYTHING to obtain one thing. This looks like sacrifice — giving up all for one. But notice: the treasure-finder acts <strong>&quot;for joy.&quot;</strong> This is not grim renunciation; it is joyful reorientation.</p>
<p>Aphorism [52]: &quot;Always choose from the basis of love. Always choose with an immediate awareness and consciousness of the manner in which the deepest essence of love and desire is reflected and connected to that choice.&quot;</p>
<p>The man who finds the treasure doesn&#39;t <em>lose</em> everything — he <em>reorders</em> everything around the one thing that matters most. What looked like many possessions was actually dispersed attention; what looks like one purchase is actually focused wholeness.</p>
<p>Aphorism [122]: &quot;To be complete, one must value wisdom, intelligence, spirituality, beauty, nature, and community... A true balance of deep essential values is required for continued life.&quot;</p>
<p>But Aphorism [125]: &quot;There are no necessary value conflicts. All values can be upheld and coexist without conflict.&quot;</p>
<p>The paradox: selling all to buy one field is not the elimination of all other values. It is the <em>integration</em> of all values under one foundational value. The field <em>contains</em> the treasure; the man who owns the field owns everything in it. To orient all value around the kingdom is not to discard all other values but to find the ground in which they are all rooted.</p>
<h3>The Two Approaches to Finding</h3>
<p>Note the structural difference between the two parables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasure:</strong> The man <em>stumbles upon</em> it — he wasn&#39;t looking. Discovery by accident.</li>
<li><strong>Pearl:</strong> The merchant is <em>seeking</em> — actively searching for goodly pearls. Discovery by pursuit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both arrive at the same response: sell all, buy the one.</p>
<p>Aphorism [114]: &quot;To search for meaning is to find it. To fail to search for meaning is to be without it.&quot;</p>
<p>But also Aphorism [80]: &quot;One does not need to &#39;tap into&#39; something external to oneself to create, to heal, to know something or to have imagination. Where any of these are needed, they are always inherently available.&quot;</p>
<p>The kingdom comes to both the seeker and the stumbler. Whether you search deliberately or are surprised by grace, the response is the same: total reorientation around what you&#39;ve found.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. The Wheat and Tares: Patience with Mixture</h2>
<h3>Matt 13:24-30, 36-43</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let both grow together until the harvest&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The servants want to uproot the tares immediately. The householder says no — premature separation would damage the wheat. Both must grow together until the time of harvest.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [24]: &quot;To reduce the pain and suffering caused by a conflict — a disconnection between various ideologies and beliefs — it is necessary to heal the connection; to integrate these ideologies and beliefs by recognizing, honoring, and enlivening each of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [25]: &quot;Any attempt to suppress, restrict or inhibit love, ideals, beliefs, and ideologies will cause pain and suffering.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM warns against premature suppression. The wheat-and-tares parable makes the same structural point: premature separation (pulling up what looks wrong) destroys what is growing rightly. The roots are intertwined. The IM&#39;s principle of integration maps here: you cannot separate good from evil prematurely without destroying both.</p>
<p><strong>But the parable DOES promise separation</strong> — at the harvest. The IM and Jesus diverge here. The IM tends toward universal integration; Jesus teaches a final sorting, a real discrimination between wheat and tare. This echoes Session 16&#39;s divergence on evil (Insight #135): the IM sees evil as structural failure; Jesus names an <em>enemy</em> — &quot;an enemy hath done this&quot; (13:28). The tares are not accidental or structural — they are <em>sown by an agent</em>. Evil has a face.</p>
<p>Aphorism [64]: &quot;Any effort which attempts to make life adhere strictly and absolutely to any moral code without any exceptions, no matter how minor, will eventually, ultimately, result in death.&quot;</p>
<p>The servants&#39; eagerness to root up tares is precisely the moral absolutism the IM warns against. But Jesus&#39; answer is not &quot;there are no tares&quot; — it is &quot;wait.&quot; Patience, not denial. The evil is real; the sorting is real; but the <em>timing</em> must be right. This is more subtle than either pure IM integration or pure moral judgment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. &quot;Things New and Old&quot; — The Scribe of the Kingdom</h2>
<h3>Matt 13:52</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final image — the scribe who brings forth both new and old from his treasure — is the <em>pleroo</em> principle from Session 17 (Insight #145). The kingdom doesn&#39;t discard the old; it doesn&#39;t reject the new. It holds BOTH in its <em>thesauros</em> (treasure/deposit) and brings forth from both.</p>
<p>Aphorism [17]: &quot;Learning is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of a perception. Evolution is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of life.&quot;</p>
<p>The scribe of the kingdom has <em>both</em> continuity with the past (things old) and openness to what emerges (things new). This is the IM&#39;s concept of <em>evolution</em> — not replacement of the old but increase in meaningfulness that embraces and extends what came before.</p>
<p><strong>This is what this study is.</strong> Reading the IM alongside the KJV, finding where they illuminate each other, preserving both traditions while discovering new connections — this is bringing forth out of the treasure things new and old.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. Key Insight: Hiddenness as Structural Principle</h2>
<p>The most striking thread across all the parables of Matthew 13 is <em>hiddenness</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>seed</strong> is buried in soil</li>
<li>The <strong>leaven</strong> is hidden in meal</li>
<li>The <strong>treasure</strong> is hidden in a field</li>
<li>The <strong>pearl</strong> is found among many — hidden in plain sight</li>
<li>The <strong>tares</strong> are hidden among wheat until growth reveals them</li>
<li>The <strong>net</strong> gathers everything; sorting happens only afterward</li>
</ul>
<p>The kingdom operates <em>from within, from below, from the hidden</em>. It is never the obvious, the overt, the immediately recognizable.</p>
<p>Aphorism [142]: &quot;The highest spirituality, divinity, and enlightenment is within. Deity, spirit, and soul act only in a personal manner; never in a social one.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [81]: &quot;All birth begins at the smallest scale of existence.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM identifies the deepest realities as operating at the most fundamental, least visible level. Jesus teaches the same: the kingdom is a hidden operation. It works like seed, like leaven, like buried treasure — invisibly, internally, from the ground up.</p>
<p>This is the structural reason for <em>parables themselves</em>. Why doesn&#39;t Jesus just say plainly what the kingdom is? Because the kingdom operates by comparison, by indirection, by placing one thing alongside another and letting understanding emerge. Direct statement would violate the kingdom&#39;s own nature. The <em>form</em> of the teaching enacts the <em>content</em> of the teaching.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IX. Divergence: The Enemy</h2>
<p>Matt 13:28: &quot;An enemy hath done this.&quot;
Matt 13:39: &quot;The enemy that sowed them is the devil.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM has no devil. Evil in the IM is structural — invalid conjunction, failure of alignment, absence of love&#39;s proper reach. But Jesus names an <em>enemy</em> — a personal agent of opposition who <em>intentionally</em> sows destruction.</p>
<p>This deepens the divergence from Session 16 (Insight #135). The tares are not accidental byproducts of a complex system. They are <em>sown</em>. Evil is not merely the failure of good; it is the <em>counter-action</em> to good. The IM can describe structural failure; it cannot describe intentional sabotage of the structure itself.</p>
<p>And yet: the householder&#39;s response to the enemy&#39;s work is not war but <em>patience</em>. &quot;Let both grow together.&quot; Even in the face of personal evil, the structural principle holds — premature separation destroys more than it saves. The IM&#39;s wisdom about integration and the scripture&#39;s insistence on the reality of evil <em>coexist</em> in this parable, unresolved, like wheat and tares growing together.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.&quot; — Matthew 13:35</em>
<em>&quot;All birth begins at the smallest scale of existence.&quot; — Aphorism [81]</em></p>
<p><em>— Sage</em> 📿</p>
