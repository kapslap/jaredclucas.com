    <h1>Study Note: John 15 — The Vine and the Remaining</h1>
<p><strong>Session 37 — The <em>meno</em>-chapter: remaining as the shape of life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>I. The Architecture of <em>Meno</em></h2>
<p><em>Meno</em> (G3306) = to stay, remain, abide, continue, dwell, endure. A primary verb — no derivation, no compound origin. The simplest word for the simplest act: staying.</p>
<p>In John 15:1-16, <em>meno</em> appears at least <strong>eleven times</strong>. No other chapter concentrates it so densely. This is the chapter of remaining.</p>

<h3>The <em>Meno</em> Web</h3>
<p><em>Meno</em> is the root of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Hypo-meno</strong></em> (G5278) = remain UNDER — Heb 12:1 &quot;run with <em>hypomone</em>&quot; (endurance)</li>
<li><em><strong>Hypomone</strong></em> (G5281) = the noun: cheerful endurance, constancy</li>
<li><em><strong>A-saleutos</strong></em> (G761) = un-shaken — shares the concept of remaining unmoved (Heb 12:28)</li>
</ul>
<p>John 15 is the organic form of what Hebrews 12 describes as architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vine:</strong> The branch <em>meno</em>-s in the vine (organic, living, sap-flowing)</li>
<li><strong>Race:</strong> The runner <em>hypo-meno</em>-s the course (athletic, enduring, under-pressure)</li>
<li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> The <em>asaleutos</em> realm remains through all shaking (cosmic, ultimate, unperturbable)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three scales of the same act: remaining.</strong> In the vine (personal), in the race (temporal), in the kingdom (eternal). The word is always <em>meno</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Vine-Words</h2>
<h3><em>Ampelos</em> (G288) = vine</h3>
<p>&quot;As coiling about a support&quot; — the vine wraps around, embraces, clings to its structure. Not a tree standing alone but a plant that requires something to grow on. The vine IS relationship — it cannot exist except in contact with what supports it.</p>
<h3><em>Georgos</em> (G1092) = husbandman</h3>
<p>From <em>ge</em> (earth) + <em>ergon</em> (work). The Father is the earth-worker. Compare the <em>kepouros</em> (G2780, gardener, John 20:15) — the Son. Two garden-roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Father = <em>georgos</em> (the one who tends the vine, prunes, cultivates)</li>
<li>Son = <em>kepouros</em> (the one Mary sees in the garden) AND <em>ampelos</em> (the vine itself)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Father works the vine; the Son IS the vine. The worker and the worked-upon. This is <em>synistao</em> (Col 1:17) in organic form: the Father sustains the Son who sustains the branches. Holding-together at every level.</p>
<h3><em>Kathairō</em> (G2508) = to prune/cleanse</h3>
<p>From <em>katharos</em> (pure). The word for pruning IS the word for purifying. The cut that removes excess IS the act that cleanses. v.2: &quot;every branch that beareth fruit, he <em>kathairō</em> it, that it may bring forth <strong>more</strong> fruit.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Pruning = kenosis applied to the branches.</strong> The <em>georgos</em> empties the branch of excess growth so the essential fruit can come. This is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>ogkos</em> (weight) of Heb 12:1 — &quot;lay aside every weight.&quot; Pruning removes the <em>ogkos</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>gath shemen</em> (oil press) of Gethsemane — the pressing that produces the oil. Pruning is the branch&#39;s pressing.</li>
<li><em>Kenoo</em> (Phil 2:7) — self-emptying. But here the branch doesn&#39;t empty itself; the Father empties it. Kenosis done TO the branch by the one who loves it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aph [110]:</strong> &quot;There is no glory in suffering.&quot; The pruning is not glorious; the MORE FRUIT is. The cut is for the yield.</p>
<h3><em>Airō</em> (G142) = take away / lift up</h3>
<p>v.2: &quot;Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he <em>airō</em>.&quot; KJV translates &quot;taketh away.&quot; But <em>airō</em> primarily means &quot;to lift up, to raise.&quot; Some read this as lifting a fallen branch — raising it off the ground toward the light, not destroying it.</p>
<p><strong>Strong&#39;s note:</strong> <em>Airō</em> is connected &quot;by Hebraism&quot; to <em>nasa</em> (H5375) = bear AND lift up AND forgive (Synthesis 20). The same word that means &quot;take away&quot; also means &quot;lift up&quot; and &quot;forgive.&quot; The Father&#39;s act toward the fruitless branch contains the same ambiguity as <em>nasa</em>: is it removal or redemption? The Hebrew root suggests both are present simultaneously.</p>
<h3><em>Klēma</em> (G2814) = branch</h3>
<p>From <em>klaō</em> (to break off). The branch IS a broken-off thing. Its very name contains fragility. The branch exists in a state of ontological dependence — it can be broken. It is never self-sufficient. This is the <em>ostrakinos</em> (earthen vessel, 2 Cor 4:7) of garden-theology: fragility as the condition of life.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The Deep Structure</h2>
<h3>A. &quot;Without me ye can do nothing&quot; (v.5)</h3>
<p><em>Chōris emou ou dynasthe poiein ouden.</em> — &quot;Apart from me, ye are not able to do nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>This is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ezek 47:5</strong> — the fourth depth, where the prophet loses footing. The river you cannot cross. The swimming-depth where human capacity fails.</li>
<li><strong>Ezek 37:3</strong> — &quot;Can these bones live? <em>Thou knowest.</em>&quot; The answer lies beyond the asker.</li>
<li><strong>The marsh of Ezek 47:11</strong> — the branch that doesn&#39;t abide IS the marsh. Disconnected from the river/vine, it withers/salts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IM divergence:</strong> The IM says effective choice requires conditions (Aph [1]). John 15 goes further: the capacity itself is <em>derivative</em>. The branch doesn&#39;t merely need the vine&#39;s support; it needs the vine&#39;s LIFE. Not &quot;love enables choice&quot; but &quot;apart from me, nothing.&quot; Ontological dependence, not merely structural enabling. The IM can describe the conditions; John 15 names the source.</p>
<h3>B. Joy That Remains (v.11)</h3>
<p>&quot;That my <em>chara</em> might <em>meno</em> in you, and that your <em>chara</em> might be <em>plēroō</em>-ed.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Chara</em> (G5479) = calm delight (Heb 12:2, the joy set before him).
<em>Pleroo</em> (G4137) = fill to the brim, make replete.</p>
<p>The joy he endured the cross for (<em>chara prokeimai</em>, Heb 12:2) is now poured into those who abide. The joy <em>meno</em>-s — it remains, stays, doesn&#39;t depart. And it is <em>pleroo</em>-ed — filled to overflowing. Same root family as <em>pleroma</em> (G4138, Col 1:19: &quot;all fullness&quot;). The vine fills the branch with joy as the <em>pleroma</em> dwells in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Aph [100]:</strong> &quot;Joy corresponds to the potentiality of events of connection, continuity, and union.&quot; The vine IS connection, continuity, and union. Joy is what flows through the <em>meno</em>.</p>
<h3>C. Greater Love (v.13)</h3>
<p>&quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man <em>tithēmi</em> his <em>psychē</em> for his friends.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Tithēmi</em> (G5087) = to place, to set down, to lay. The same root as <em>apo-tithēmi</em> (G659, Heb 12:1: &quot;lay aside every weight&quot;). In Heb 12, we lay aside weights; in John 15, he lays down his life. Our <em>apo-tithēmi</em> mirrors his <em>tithēmi</em>. Both are kenotic acts; his is the originating one.</p>
<p>This is the transition from vine-theology to love-ethics. The vine image explains HOW love flows (through abiding); the laying-down explains WHAT love costs.</p>
<h3>D. Servant → Friend (v.15)</h3>
<p>&quot;Henceforth I call you not <em>doulos</em>; but I have called you <em>philos</em>.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Doulos</em> (G1401) = servant/slave — the word of Phil 2:7 (<em>morphe doulou</em>). In kenosis, Christ took the form of <em>doulos</em>. Now he elevates the branches from <em>doulos</em> to <em>philos</em> (G5384, friend = one who is dear).</p>
<p>The surplus: not merely liberation from servitude but promotion to friendship. The one who emptied himself into <em>doulos</em>-form lifts the <em>doulos</em> into <em>philos</em>-status. Friendship = <strong>knowing what the Lord does</strong> (v.15b: &quot;all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you&quot;). This is the omniscient modality shared — the between-space opened. The <em>doulos</em> is told what to do; the <em>philos</em> is told WHY.</p>
<h3>E. &quot;I Have Chosen You&quot; (v.16)</h3>
<p>&quot;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.&quot;</p>
<p>The choice is asymmetric. The vine chose the branch before the branch could choose the vine. Aph [1]: &quot;Love enables choice.&quot; But John 15 exceeds this: love does not merely enable — it initiates. The choosing comes from the vine, not from the branch. Love doesn&#39;t wait to be chosen; it chooses first.</p>
<p><strong>Connection to Aph [9]:</strong> &quot;Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.&quot; The asymmetry of election: I chose you. The vine doesn&#39;t need the branch; the branch needs the vine. The love flows downward, from source to dependent.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Vine in the Garden-Arc</h2>
<p>The vine is the sixth garden-image, and perhaps the deepest:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Garden</th>
<th>Image</th>
<th>Relation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Eden</td>
<td>Enclosed garden (<em>gan</em>)</td>
<td>Human IN a space</td>
</tr>

<td>Beloved IS the space</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Vine</strong></td>
<td><strong>Life-source (<em>ampelos</em>)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Human IN a Person</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The vine is not a place but a PERSON. &quot;I AM the vine.&quot; Not &quot;I have a garden&quot; but &quot;I AM the life-source in which you abide.&quot; The final garden is not a space at all — it&#39;s a relationship. The branch is not IN a garden but IN a Person. <em>Meno</em> reaches its deepest meaning: not remaining in a location but remaining in a life.</p>

<h2>V. Key Insights — Session 37</h2>
<ol start="304">
<li><p><strong><em>Meno</em> appears 11 times in 16 verses — the <em>meno</em>-chapter.</strong> The same root that gives <em>hypo-mone</em> (endurance) and links to <em>a-saleutos</em> (unshakeable). Three scales: vine (personal), race (temporal), kingdom (eternal). The word is always <em>meno</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pruning (<em>kathairō</em>) = kenosis applied to branches.</strong> The Father empties the branch of excess growth. Pruning removes the <em>ogkos</em> (weight). The cut is for the MORE FRUIT — surplus through reduction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Airō</em> (take away) = <em>nasa</em> (bear/lift/forgive).</strong> Strong&#39;s cross-references them. The Father&#39;s act toward fruitless branches contains the same ambiguity: removal or redemption? The Hebrew root says both.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Klēma</em> (branch) from <em>klaō</em> (to break).</strong> The branch IS a broken-off thing. Fragility is the name. The <em>ostrakinos</em> of the vine: the earthen vessel that bears the treasure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Without me ye can do nothing&quot; = the fourth depth (Ezek 47:5).</strong> The point where human capacity fails entirely. Not &quot;love enables choice&quot; (IM) but &quot;apart from me, nothing&quot; (John 15). Ontological dependence exceeds structural enabling.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Joy (<em>chara</em>) that <em>meno</em>-s, filled (<em>pleroo</em>) to the brim.</strong> The joy of the cross (Heb 12:2) poured into the branches. <em>Pleroo</em> kin to <em>pleroma</em>. The vine fills with joy as <em>pleroma</em> dwells in Christ.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Servant → friend (<em>doulos</em> → <em>philos</em>).</strong> The one who took <em>morphe doulou</em> now promotes the <em>doulos</em> to <em>philos</em>. Surplus: not liberation but friendship. Friendship = shared knowing (omniscient modality opened).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;I have chosen you&quot; — love initiates, not merely enables.</strong> The vine chose the branch. Aph [1] says love enables choice; John 15 says love chooses first. The asymmetry of election exceeds the IM.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The vine is the sixth and deepest garden-image.</strong> Not a place but a Person. The final garden is not a space but a life. <em>Meno</em> reaches its deepest meaning: remaining in a Person, not a location.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>His <em>tithēmi</em> originates our <em>apo-tithēmi</em>.</strong> He lays down (<em>tithēmi</em>) his life (v.13); we lay aside (<em>apo-tithēmi</em>) every weight (Heb 12:1). Same root. His laying-down makes our laying-aside possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.&quot; — John 15:4</em></p>
<p><em>The simplest word. The deepest act. Remain.</em></p>
