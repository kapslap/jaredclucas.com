    <h1>The Sermon on the Mount and the Immanent Metaphysics</h1>
<h2>Study Notes — 2026-02-01 (Session 17)</h2>
<hr>
<h2>I. The Beatitudes as a Map of Effective Choice</h2>
<p>The Beatitudes (Matt 5:3-12) are not merely ethical ideals. Read through the IM lens, they describe the <em>structural conditions</em> under which choice becomes most effective — where the self becomes maximally creative and aligned.</p>
<h3>&quot;Blessed&quot; — <em>makarios</em> (G3107)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>μακάριος</strong> — &quot;supremely blest; by extension, fortunate, well off&quot;</li>
<li>Not mere happiness. A prolonged form of the poetical <em>makar</em>, which originally described the gods&#39; state — a blessedness beyond circumstance.</li>
<li>The IM parallel: <em>effective choice</em> is not about outcome but about the <em>structural alignment</em> of the chooser.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Beatitudes Mapped:</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Poor in spirit&quot; → Aphorism [77]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ability to realize creation and creativity increases with one&#39;s clarity and transparency — an inner silence, peace, and potentiality.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poverty of spirit = emptiness = <em>potentiality</em>. The IM framework identifies potentiality as the ground of creation. The kingdom belongs to those who are empty enough to be filled — who maintain the openness from which choice arises.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;They that mourn&quot; → Aphorism [26]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mourning = awareness of discontinuity. The IM says pain <em>draws attention</em> to what needs healing (Aphorism [36]). Comfort comes not by escaping grief but by allowing it to complete its work of reconnection.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The meek&quot; — <em>praus</em> (G4239):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>πραΰς</strong> — &quot;mild, humble&quot; — a primary word</li>
<li>In classical Greek, <em>praus</em> described a wild horse that had been broken — power under control, not weakness</li>
<li>Aphorism [138]: &quot;To be truly and vibrantly alive... some element of wildness will always be necessary&quot;</li>
<li>The meek inherit the earth because <em>disciplined power</em> is more effective than raw force. The IM would say: the meek are those whose strength is <em>integrated</em>, not suppressed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Hunger and thirst after righteousness&quot; → Aphorism [92]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One chooses most effectively when choosing and continuing to choose, from one&#39;s deepest basis of desire.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hunger is not willpower; it is <em>alignment with one&#39;s deepest desire</em>. The IM identifies desire as the root of effective choice. Those who hunger for righteousness are those whose root desire has found its object.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The merciful&quot; → Aphorism [41]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All healing is contact; it inherently involves touching and connection.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercy = contact with the suffering of another. The IM says healing is always relational, always <em>between</em>. Mercy given becomes mercy received — not as transaction but as structure. When I reach toward another&#39;s discontinuity, the reaching itself is healing.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Pure in heart&quot; → Aphorism [146]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The purification and clarification of self is what allows for the divine nature of our innermost self to shine through.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Aphorism [143]: &quot;To become enlightened is to become full of light. To be full of light one must have clarity and be clear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They shall see God&quot; — the pure heart is the <em>clarified</em> heart, the one through which light passes undistorted. The IM says clarity enables perception. Purity here is not moral sterility but <em>transparency</em> — a self that does not obstruct its own seeing.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Peacemakers&quot; → Aphorisms [24]-[25]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To reduce the pain and suffering caused by a conflict... it is necessary to heal the connection; to integrate these ideologies and beliefs by recognizing, honoring, and enlivening each of them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peacemaking in the IM is <em>integration</em> — not suppression of conflict but its resolution through expansion. &quot;Children of God&quot; because creation itself is integrative — God&#39;s fundamental act.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Persecuted for righteousness&#39; sake&quot; → Aphorism [65]:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In any world, it will always appear and seem that all objective worldly experiences will ultimately be ones of pain and suffering.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The IM acknowledges that alignment with truth will often produce objective suffering. Joy &quot;cannot be seen or known objectively; they must always be known subjectively.&quot; The persecuted are <em>blessed</em> not despite suffering but because their alignment with truth is real even when the world cannot recognize it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. &quot;Be Ye Therefore Perfect&quot; — <em>Teleios</em> as Completeness</h2>
<h3>Matthew 5:48</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Teleios</em> (G5046)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>τέλειος</strong> — &quot;complete (in various applications of labor, growth, mental and moral character, etc.)&quot;</li>
<li>From <strong>τέλος</strong> (G5056) — &quot;properly, the point aimed at as a limit, i.e. the conclusion of an act or state&quot;</li>
<li>NOT &quot;flawless&quot; in the modern English sense. Rather: <em>having reached one&#39;s telos</em>, one&#39;s intended end, one&#39;s fullness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [124]: &quot;The degree of the perfection of value is the product of the degree to which one values all things and values all things equally.&quot;</p>
<p>This is extraordinary. Jesus says: be <em>teleios</em> as God is <em>teleios</em>. The context is <strong>loving enemies</strong> — extending love beyond the comfortable boundary. God&#39;s perfection is demonstrated in making &quot;his sun to rise on the evil and on the good&quot; (5:45). God&#39;s completeness is <em>the completeness of love&#39;s reach</em>.</p>
<p>The IM says exactly this: perfection of value = valuing all things equally. Not because all things are the same, but because <em>love does not discriminate by merit</em>.</p>
<p>Aphorism [4]: &quot;Love is unconditional; it cannot be earned.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Teleios</em> perfection is not moral achievement. It is the <em>completion</em> of love&#39;s extension — loving the enemy, the stranger, the rain falling on the unjust. The IM framework would describe this as the removal of <em>invalid conjunctions</em> — conditions placed on love that love itself does not contain.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The Single Eye — <em>Haplous</em> and the Undivided Self</h2>
<h3>Matthew 6:22-23</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Haplous</em> (G573)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>ἁπλοῦς</strong> — &quot;properly, folded together, i.e. single (figuratively, clear)&quot;</li>
<li>Derivation: from alpha (particle of union) + the base of <em>pleko</em> (to weave/fold)</li>
<li>Literally: <em>woven together into one</em> — unified, not divided</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [47]: &quot;One chooses most effectively when choosing as a unified self, as a whole being, with attunement and at-one-ment with one&#39;s innermost and deepest nature.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [48]: &quot;The potentiality for joy in a self, relationship, or community increases with its internal coherency, consistency, and continuity. Where self or community is internally divided, there is much less freedom of choice.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;single eye&quot; is the <em>undivided self</em>. When the self is <em>haplous</em> — woven together, unified — the whole being is illuminated. When the self is divided (&quot;evil eye&quot; — split attention, double purpose), darkness fills the whole.</p>
<p>This is the IM&#39;s argument about effective choice: a divided self has less freedom, less potentiality, less capacity to act. The two masters of Matt 6:24 — &quot;No man can serve two masters&quot; — is the practical consequence. Division of devotion = division of self = diminished choice.</p>
<p>The word <em>haplous</em> itself — &quot;folded together&quot; — resonates with the IM&#39;s concept of <em>integration</em>. Light fills the body when the self is integrated, woven together, when all aspects of self are in alignment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. Love Your Enemies — Love as Continuity, Not Symmetry</h2>
<h3>Matthew 5:43-48</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you... For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The IM&#39;s Most Direct Parallel</h3>
<p>Aphorism [9]: <strong>&quot;Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This may be the single most important cross-reference in the entire study. Jesus&#39; argument is precisely this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loving those who love you = <em>symmetry</em>. The publicans do this. It&#39;s exchange, not love.</li>
<li>Loving enemies = <em>continuity</em>. Love that persists regardless of the other&#39;s response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aphorism [5]: &quot;Love has only the intention of giving; it is never about exchange, barter, or expectation.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;reward&quot; question in Matt 5:46 is the <em>test of symmetry</em>. If love is defined by what returns to you, it is symmetric — merely a transaction. But love <em>known by its continuity</em> extends without condition, without return, without reciprocity.</p>
<p>And then Matt 5:45 — the sun rises on evil and good, rain falls on just and unjust. This is <em>cosmic continuity</em>. God&#39;s love is not responsive to merit; it is <em>structurally continuous</em>. It flows because it flows. The IM describes this at the deepest level: love is that which enables choice ([1]), love has no opposite ([3]), love cannot be earned ([4]).</p>
<p><strong>The radical claim:</strong> What Jesus demands of his followers is precisely what the IM describes as the <em>fundamental nature of love itself</em>. Love your enemies is not a moral exhortation imposed from outside — it is the <em>structural truth</em> about what love is. To love only those who love you back is to fail to be <em>in love at all</em>, by the IM&#39;s definition. You are merely in exchange.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Strait Gate — Limitation as Freedom</h2>
<h3>Matthew 7:13-14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Stenos</em> (G4728)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>στενός</strong> — &quot;narrow (from obstacles standing close about)&quot;</li>
<li>Derivation: probably from the base of <em>histemi</em> (G2476) — to stand, to cause to stand</li>
<li>The obstacles <em>stand</em> close. Narrowness is not absence but <em>presence</em> — things pressing in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [91]: &quot;All choice involves both freedom and limitation. Limitation and freedom always occur together, they are inseparable. There is no &#39;transcendence&#39; of limitation.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [109]: &quot;Within the seeming limitation of the discipline of effective choice, a true freedom of life is found.&quot;</p>
<p>The strait gate is the IM&#39;s <em>effective choice</em>. The broad way — permissive, easy, undisciplined — appears to offer freedom but leads to destruction (loss of potentiality). The narrow way — disciplined, constrained, requiring focus — appears to restrict but leads to <em>life</em> (increased potentiality).</p>
<p>This is counterintuitive by design. The IM explains why: effective choice requires both freedom AND limitation operating together. A choice that is all freedom and no limitation is not a choice at all — it&#39;s drift. The narrow gate <em>is</em> the gate precisely because its constraints are what make genuine choosing possible.</p>
<p>Aphorism [33]: &quot;Mental and physical processes work best as the result of constrictive choices; choices that have the effect of limiting potentiality.&quot;</p>
<p>The obstacles standing close about (<em>stenos</em>) are not punishments but <em>conditions for genuine agency</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. &quot;Not to Destroy but to Fulfil&quot; — Continuity of the Law</h2>
<h3>Matthew 5:17-18</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Pleroo</em> (G4137)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>πληρόω</strong> — &quot;to make replete, to fill up, to complete, to finish, to verify&quot;</li>
<li>From <em>pleres</em> — full, complete</li>
<li>Not &quot;to replace&quot; or &quot;to add to&quot; but <em>to fill to the brim</em> — to bring to completion</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>The IM framework&#39;s concept of <em>continuity</em> — the new does not negate the old but <em>completes</em> it. Transformation preserves while transcending.</p>
<p>Jesus&#39; claim is structural: the law is not wrong, it is <em>incomplete</em>. It requires filling. The &quot;but I say unto you&quot; formulations that follow (5:21-48) are not contradictions of the law but its <em>completion</em> — moving from external act to internal state, from behavior to being.</p>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; → anger itself is the root (5:21-22)
&quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot; → desire itself is the root (5:27-28)
&quot;An eye for an eye&quot; → non-retaliation (5:38-39)
&quot;Love thy neighbor&quot; → love your enemies (5:43-44)</p>
<p>Each &quot;fulfillment&quot; moves <em>inward</em> and <em>expands outward</em>. The act becomes the intention. The bounded obligation becomes the unbounded one. This is exactly the IM&#39;s pattern: continuity of principle with expansion of scope.</p>
<p>Aphorism [17]: &quot;Learning is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of a perception. Evolution is that which occurs when there is an increase in the meaningfulness of life.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Pleroo</em> = the law <em>evolves</em> — its meaningfulness increases while its identity is preserved.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. Judge Not — Perception Without Precondition</h2>
<h3>Matthew 7:1-5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged... why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&#39;s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [16]: &quot;Perception is effective to the degree that it is dispassionate, without judgment, precondition or expectation.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [58]: &quot;No one is ever wholly wrong; there is always a grain of truth in whatever anyone says or is in their being. Rather than focusing only on what is false or who or what is at fault, wisdom involves focusing on whoever and whatever is true, whole, wholesome, valid, and right.&quot;</p>
<p>The beam-and-mote teaching is about <em>obstructed perception</em>. You cannot see clearly through a beam. Judgment, in the IM framework, is a <em>precondition</em> placed on perception — it distorts before it sees. Jesus&#39; command is structural: clear your own perception first, then you may see to help another.</p>
<p>Aphorism [59]: &quot;The practice and implementation of ethics involves personal choice; it is never concerned with either justice or judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM draws the same line: ethics is about <em>your own choices</em>, not judging another&#39;s. Jesus says exactly this — attend to the beam in your own eye.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. Take No Thought for the Morrow — Choice in the Present</h2>
<h3>Matthew 6:25-34</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Take no thought for your life... Behold the fowls of the air... Consider the lilies of the field...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [108]: &quot;One cannot choose in the past or in the future; one can only make choices in the present. In that the overwhelming majority of one&#39;s being is here and now, so also are one&#39;s choices most effective here and now.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [69]: &quot;Inner peace and security is found in a potentiality to act, regardless of what could happen or has happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [72]: &quot;True security is intrinsic to self; it cannot be found in any world; it cannot be taken away.&quot;</p>
<p>Jesus&#39; teaching on anxiety maps precisely to the IM&#39;s framework of <em>present-moment choice</em>. Anxiety about tomorrow is the attempt to choose in the future — which the IM declares impossible. The birds and lilies don&#39;t plan because they live in present-moment participation in the flow of life.</p>
<p>&quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&quot; (6:33)</p>
<p>Aphorism [52]: &quot;Always choose from the basis of love.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;kingdom of God&quot; = the ground from which all effective choice arises. Seek the foundation first; the rest follows structurally.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IX. The Golden Rule — Effective Choice as Ethics</h2>
<h3>Matthew 7:12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [89]: &quot;An ultimately effective choice is one which realizes the ultimate desires of all who make that choice, and all who are affected by that choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [95]: &quot;It is always possible to choose in a manner that is win-win for all involved, including oneself, at all levels of being.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [94]: &quot;Any choice which is truly and ultimately supportive and nurturing of all aspects of one&#39;s being will also have consequences which are supportive of all other beings.&quot;</p>
<p>The Golden Rule is the IM&#39;s principle of <em>effective choice</em> expressed as ethical maxim. &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot; is not mere reciprocity — it is the recognition that effective choice <em>is inherently ethical</em>. What genuinely serves self, at the deepest level, genuinely serves other. What truly harms other, at the deepest level, harms self.</p>
<p>Jesus adds: &quot;for this is the law and the prophets.&quot; The entire legal and prophetic tradition — all of it — reduces to this single structural principle. The IM would agree: effective choice, made from love, is the foundation from which all ethics arise.</p>
<hr>
<h2>X. Secret Prayer — The Personal Nature of the Divine</h2>
<h3>Matthew 6:5-6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [142]: &quot;The highest spirituality, divinity, and enlightenment is within. Deity, spirit, and soul act only in a personal manner; never in a social one.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [65]: &quot;Joy, comfort and connectedness, although real, cannot be seen or known objectively; they must always be known subjectively as an invisible and innate aspect of self.&quot;</p>
<p>Jesus insists: prayer is personal, not performative. The Father &quot;seeth in secret&quot; — spiritual reality operates in the subjective, the personal, the hidden. The IM makes the same structural claim: divinity acts &quot;only in a personal manner; never in a social one.&quot;</p>
<p>The hypocrites who pray publicly &quot;have their reward&quot; — they got what they were actually seeking: social recognition. But the one who prays in the closet accesses what is <em>real</em> — the subjective encounter with the divine that cannot be objectified or displayed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>XI. Key Insight: The Sermon as Structural Ethics</h2>
<p>The most striking finding of this study is that the Sermon on the Mount is not primarily a moral code — it is a <em>description of the structure of effective life</em>. Read through the IM, every command reveals a structural principle:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Jesus says</th>
<th>IM equivalent</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Be poor in spirit</td>
<td>Maintain potentiality/openness</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Love your enemies</td>
<td>Love is continuity, not symmetry</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be perfect (teleios)</td>
<td>Reach completeness through universal love</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Golden Rule</td>
<td>Effective choice is inherently ethical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pray in secret</td>
<td>The divine is personal, not social</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fulfil, not destroy</td>
<td>Continuity preserves while transcending</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The Sermon is not &quot;do these things to earn merit.&quot; It is &quot;this is how reality works; align with it and live.&quot; The beatitudes are not rewards for good behavior — they are descriptions of <em>what happens when</em> a self is structurally aligned with love, continuity, and choice.</p>
<p>This is what separates the Sermon from mere moralism: Jesus is not imposing rules from outside. He is describing the architecture of effective life. The IM gives us the formal language for what Jesus teaches as parable and command.</p>
<hr>
<h2>XII. Where They Diverge (continuing the tradition of honest divergence)</h2>
<p><strong>The Personal Address.</strong> The IM describes structural principles. Jesus addresses <em>persons</em> — &quot;ye,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; &quot;thy Father.&quot; The Sermon cannot exist without a speaker and an audience. The IM&#39;s truths are impersonal; Jesus&#39; truths are spoken face to face. &quot;Love your enemies&quot; hits differently when a <em>person</em> says it to <em>persons</em> than when it appears as a structural property of reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Father.</strong> The IM has no Father. The Sermon on the Mount is saturated with &quot;your Father which is in heaven&quot; — nine times in three chapters. The structural principles may be identical, but the Sermon roots them in a <em>relationship</em>, not a framework. &quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of God&quot; presupposes a King.</p>
<p><strong>Authority.</strong> Matt 7:28-29: &quot;he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.&quot; The people are astonished because Jesus speaks these structural truths <em>as his own</em>. He doesn&#39;t derive them from prior authority or from formal analysis. He speaks them because he <em>is</em> them. The IM derives its authority from logical coherence. Jesus derives his from personal identity with the truth he teaches. This is the gap between structure and incarnation.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;Within the seeming limitation of the discipline of effective choice, a true freedom of life is found.&quot; — Aphorism [109]</em>
<em>&quot;Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life.&quot; — Matthew 7:14</em></p>
