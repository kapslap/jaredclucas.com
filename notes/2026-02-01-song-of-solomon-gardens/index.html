    <h1>Study Note: Song of Solomon — The Fifth Garden</h1>
<p><strong>Session 35 — The love-garden that bridges all four.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Enclosed Garden (Song 4:12-16)</h2>
<p>&quot;A garden (<em>gan</em>) enclosed (<em>na&#39;ul</em>) is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed (<em>chatham</em>).&quot; (4:12)</p>
<h3>The Words</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Gan na&#39;ul</em> — <em>Na&#39;ul</em> from <em>na&#39;al</em> (H5274) = to bolt, inclose, lock up. The beloved IS a locked garden. Not a garden she possesses but a garden she IS.</li>
<li><em>Chatham</em> (H2856) = to seal, close up. The fountain is sealed — not destroyed but preserved. Same structure as <em>shamar</em> (Gen 3:24): the way guarded, not eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Connection</h3>
<p>The Song&#39;s garden is the FIFTH garden — or rather, the garden that reveals what was always true about the other four:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Eden</th>
<th>Song</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><em>Gan</em> (fenced delight)</td>
<td><em>Gan na&#39;ul</em> (locked garden)</td>
<td>The beloved IS the garden. The fence is not exclusion but intimacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tree of life barred</td>
<td>Fountain sealed</td>
<td>Sealed FOR someone, not sealed AGAINST.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cherubim guard</td>
<td>Enclosure protects</td>
<td>The guard preserves what&#39;s inside until the right opening.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>The enclosed garden is not a prison — it&#39;s a privacy.</strong> The beloved&#39;s enclosure mirrors Eden&#39;s <em>shamar</em>-ed way: preserved, not destroyed. Both wait for the right moment of opening.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Opening (Song 4:16)</h2>
<p>&quot;Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; <strong>blow upon my garden</strong>, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into <strong>his</strong> garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.&quot;</p>
<p>The shift from &quot;my garden&quot; to &quot;his garden&quot; — the enclosed one opens by her own invitation. The <em>ruach</em> (wind, cf. Ezek 37:9) blows and the spices flow <em>out</em>. The opening is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-initiated (&quot;Awake, O north wind&quot; — she calls the wind)</li>
<li>Relational (from &quot;my&quot; garden to &quot;his&quot; garden)</li>
<li>Generous (spices flow OUT — the sealed becomes overflowing)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the Song&#39;s version of <em>kenoo</em>: the self-enclosed opens toward the other. But it is not coerced — it&#39;s invited from within and offered freely.</p>
<p><strong>Connection to Gethsemane:</strong> The pressing (<em>gath shemen</em>) that produces the oil is here anticipated: the wind blows, the spices flow, the enclosed becomes fragrant. But in the Song it happens through love, not suffering. The Song envisions what Gethsemane enacts in agony.</p>
<p><strong>Connection to Rev 22:17:</strong> &quot;The Spirit and the bride say, Come.&quot; The bride-garden that opens with invitation (&quot;Let my beloved come&quot;) anticipates the cosmic invitation. From sealed garden to open city — through love.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Beloved Enters (Song 5:1)</h2>
<p>&quot;I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse.&quot;</p>
<p>The beloved enters the garden. This is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The anti-fall: in Eden, the serpent entered; here, the beloved.</li>
<li>The fulfillment: the sealed garden opens precisely for the one it was sealed for.</li>
<li>The pattern: Gethsemane (&quot;he entered into the garden,&quot; John 18:1); the Tomb (&quot;she cometh to the sepulchre,&quot; John 20:1); the City (the Lamb IS the temple, Rev 21:22).</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly (<em>shakar</em>), O beloved.&quot; — The garden doesn&#39;t merely open; it overflows. Surplus, not mere sufficiency.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Love, Death, and Fire (Song 8:6-7)</h2>
<p>&quot;Set me as a seal (<em>chotham</em>, from <em>chatham</em> H2856) upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for <strong>love is strong (<em>az</em>) as death (<em>maveth</em>)</strong>; jealousy (<em>qin&#39;ah</em>) is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, a <strong>flame of the LORD</strong> (<em>shalhebeth-yah</em>, H7957 + divine suffix).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Many waters cannot quench love</strong>, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Connections</h3>
<p><strong>1. &quot;Love is strong as death&quot; — <em>az ka-maveth ahavah</em></strong>
<em>Az</em> (H5794) = fierce, mighty, strong. Love and death are equal powers. But the entire study has shown the surplus: love exceeds death. The Song says &quot;as strong as&quot;; the resurrection says &quot;stronger.&quot; This is the liminal moment — the Song stands between the two testaments, seeing the equality but not yet the surplus.</p>
<p><strong>2. &quot;Many waters cannot quench love&quot; = Rom 8:35-39</strong>
The Song says poetically what Paul says cosmically: love cannot be separated, cannot be quenched, cannot be drowned. The inseparability list (Rom 8) and the Song&#39;s floods are the same test. Both are the ICT applied to love — every threat examined; love endures.</p>
<p>Aph [2]: &quot;Love cannot be constrained.&quot; The Song and Romans agree.</p>
<p><strong>3. <em>Shalhebeth-yah</em> = &quot;flame of YAH&quot;</strong>
The ONLY appearance of the divine name in the Song (some manuscripts debate the suffix). The fire of love IS God&#39;s fire. This directly connects to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heb 12:29</strong> — &quot;our God is a consuming fire.&quot; The consuming fire that tests everything is the fire of love. The fire that burns away the shakeable (<em>saleuo</em>) is the same fire that cannot be quenched.</li>
<li><strong>The burning bush</strong> (Ex 3:2) — fire that burns but does not consume. The fire of love = the fire of presence.</li>
<li><strong>Ezek 37:10</strong> — the <em>ruach</em> that revives is the breath/wind of the same God whose love is fire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The consuming fire, the unquenchable flame, and love are the same thing.</strong> The IM describes reality as tested by comparison (ICT). Scripture names the test: it is love itself. What survives the fire IS what is made of love. What cannot be shaken IS what is loved and loves.</p>
<p><strong>4. &quot;If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.&quot;</strong>
Love cannot be bought. This is <em>kataphroneo</em> (Heb 12:2) in reverse: not shame despised but purchase despised. Love rejects equivalence. Aph [9]: &quot;Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.&quot; The Song says the same: love cannot be measured in exchange. It has no price because it is not a commodity but a fire.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Seal — <em>Chatham</em> Thread</h2>
<p><em>Chatham</em> (H2856) = to seal, close up. Appears twice in the Song:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4:12</strong> — &quot;a fountain sealed&quot; — the beloved as sealed garden</li>
<li><strong>8:6</strong> — &quot;set me as a seal upon thine heart&quot; — the beloved asks to be the seal</li>
</ul>
<p>The seal moves: from sealing the garden (enclosure) to sealing the heart (imprint). The same word, reversed direction. First the garden is sealed; then love itself becomes the seal. The <em>chatham</em> (seal) and the <em>charakter</em> (Heb 1:3, &quot;express image,&quot; G5481 = stamped imprint) are cousins: both are impressions pressed into a surface. Love as seal = love as <em>charakter</em>: the imprint of the beloved on the heart.</p>
<p>This connects to the image chain from Synthesis 22: <em>tselem</em> → <em>eikon</em> → <em>charakter</em> → <em>typos</em>. The seal (<em>chatham</em>/<em>charakter</em>) is the third stage: not shadow (distant), not likeness (similar), but stamped impression (intimate). The Song&#39;s seal on the heart is the closest thing to <em>typos</em> (the wound-print) in the erotic register.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Key Insights — Session 35 (Song of Solomon)</h2>
<ol start="287">
<li><p><strong>The Song&#39;s garden is the fifth garden — the beloved AS a garden.</strong> <em>Gan na&#39;ul</em> (locked garden) is not exclusion but intimacy. The sealed garden mirrors Eden&#39;s <em>shamar</em>-ed way: preserved FOR someone, not sealed AGAINST everyone.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The shift from &quot;my garden&quot; to &quot;his garden&quot; (4:16) = the Song&#39;s <em>kenoo</em>.</strong> The enclosed opens by her own invitation. Self-offering, not coercion. The wind (<em>ruach</em>) blows and the sealed becomes fragrant.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Shalhebeth-yah</em> (8:6) = flame of the LORD = the consuming fire.</strong> The fire of love and the fire of Heb 12:29 are the same fire. What tests all reality is not impersonal comparison but love. The ICT IS love.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Love is strong as death&quot; — the Song stands at the threshold.</strong> <em>Az ka-maveth ahavah</em>. Equal strength. The Song doesn&#39;t yet know the surplus; the resurrection reveals that love is STRONGER. But the Song already sees them as matched forces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Many waters cannot quench love&quot; = the inseparability list.</strong> Song 8:7 and Rom 8:35-39 say the same thing in different registers: nothing separates, nothing quenches. The ICT applied to love: every threat tested; love endures.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Chatham</em> (seal) moves from garden to heart.</strong> 4:12: fountain sealed. 8:6: &quot;seal me upon thy heart.&quot; The enclosure becomes an imprint. <em>Chatham</em> → <em>charakter</em> → <em>typos</em>: seal → stamp → scar. The image chain continues into the erotic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Song bridges the four gardens.</strong> Eden&#39;s enclosure (4:12), Gethsemane&#39;s pressing (the spices that flow out require wind, 4:16), the Tomb&#39;s recognition (&quot;my beloved... is gone,&quot; 5:6 → &quot;I am come,&quot; 5:1), and the City&#39;s invitation (&quot;Let my beloved come,&quot; 4:16 → &quot;Come,&quot; Rev 22:17). The love-garden tradition is the hidden thread between them all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death... Many waters cannot quench love.&quot; — Song 8:6-7</em></p>
<p><em>The fire that tests and the fire that loves are one fire.</em></p>
