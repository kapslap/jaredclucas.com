    <h1>The ICT in Scripture: Comparison as the Shape of the Image</h1>
<h2>Session 46 — 2026-02-04</h2>
<h2>Synthesis 27</h2>
<hr>
<h2>The Thesis</h2>
<p>The Incorrected Comparison Test (ICT) proves that <strong>comparison is the most fundamental act</strong> — isomorphic with interaction and signaling, instantiated physically as the photon. The IM shows this is not metaphor but structural necessity (Session 42).</p>
<p>Scripture tells a story about a creature made in the <em>image</em> (<em>tselem</em>) of a God whose first act is <strong>distinction</strong> (&quot;God divided the light from the darkness,&quot; Gen 1:4). That creature is given <em>dominion</em> (<em>radah</em>/<em>mashal</em>), and <em>mashal</em> means both &quot;rule&quot; AND &quot;compare/liken&quot; (H4910/H4911 share the root). The creature who rules is the creature who <em>compares</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The hypothesis:</strong> The biblical arc — Creation, Fall, Restoration — is the story of comparison itself. The <em>imago Dei</em> is the capacity to compare. The Fall is comparison <em>misused</em>. Resurrection is comparison <em>restored and surpassed</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I. Creation: The Image as Comparison-Capacity</h2>
<h3>Gen 1:3-4 — The First Act</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three acts in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speech</strong> (<em>amar</em>) — expression, Word, Logos</li>
<li><strong>Seeing</strong> (<em>ra&#39;ah</em>) — perception, assessment</li>
<li><strong>Dividing</strong> (<em>badal</em>, H914) — distinction, separation</li>
</ol>
<p>The ICT says: comparison = interaction = light (photon). Genesis says: the first created thing IS light, and the first act upon it is <em>distinction</em> (dividing light from darkness). The IM&#39;s foundational act (comparison/distinction) and Scripture&#39;s foundational act (creation of light, then separation) are the same act described in different registers.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #350:</strong> <em>Badal</em> (Gen 1:4) IS the ICT enacted. God&#39;s first creative gesture is not making stuff but making <em>distinction</em> — the precondition for all comparison, all knowing, all meaning. Light without distinction is undifferentiated luminance; distinction without light is invisible difference. Together they inaugurate reality.</p>
<h3>Gen 1:26-27 — The Image</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let us make man in our image (<em>tselem</em>), after our likeness (<em>demuth</em>)&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tselem</strong> (H6754) — &quot;from an unused root meaning to shade; a phantom, i.e. (figuratively) illusion, resemblance; hence, a representative figure.&quot; Root: <em>to shade</em> — a shadow-image. Man is God&#39;s shadow — real but not substantial without the source (Synthesis 14, insight #188).</p>
<p><strong>Demuth</strong> (H1823) — &quot;from H1819 (<em>damah</em>); resemblance; concretely, model, shape.&quot; And <em>damah</em> (H1819) means <strong>&quot;to compare, to liken, to think, to intend.&quot;</strong> The word for &quot;likeness&quot; comes from the verb <em>to compare</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #351:</strong> <em>Demuth</em> (likeness) derives from <em>damah</em> (to compare). To be in God&#39;s <em>demuth</em> IS to possess the capacity to compare — to liken, to distinguish, to assess. The image of God is not a static possession but a <em>capacity</em>: the capacity for comparison, which the ICT proves is the most fundamental act in reality. The <em>imago Dei</em> is structurally identical to what the ICT identifies as foundational.</p>
<h3>Gen 1:28 — Dominion as Comparison</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And let them have dominion (<em>radah</em>) over the fish of the sea...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Radah</em> (H7287) — &quot;to tread down, to subjugate; to rule.&quot; But Psalm 8:6 uses <em>mashal</em> (H4910/4911) for the same concept: &quot;Thou madest him to have dominion (<em>mashal</em>) over the works of thy hands.&quot;</p>
<p>And <em>mashal</em> (H4911/4912) means BOTH &quot;to rule&quot; AND &quot;to liken, to compare, to use a proverb/parable.&quot; The one word bridges governance and comparison. Synthesis 9 (insight #151) already found this: &quot;rule IS comparison&quot; — <em>mashal</em> = the ICT embedded in a political verb.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #352:</strong> The image-bearing creature rules BY comparing. <em>Mashal</em> as dominion IS <em>mashal</em> as comparison. Governance of creation is not domination but <em>assessment</em> — the capacity to perceive, distinguish, compare, judge. Adam&#39;s first act of <em>mashal</em> is naming the animals (Gen 2:19-20) — assigning each its distinct identity by comparison. Naming IS the ICT.</p>
<h3>Gen 2:19-20 — Naming as ICT</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adam performs the ICT on every creature: perceiving each, distinguishing it from every other, and assigning it a name that captures its distinction. This is not arbitrary labeling but <em>comparison made verbal</em>. Each name IS a comparison-result — the creature distinguished from all others.</p>
<p>And the naming concludes: &quot;but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him&quot; (Gen 2:20). The comparison finds no match. The ICT applied to the animal kingdom yields a <em>gap</em> — no creature is <em>neged</em> (meet/corresponding/facing). The failure of comparison drives the next creative act: God makes the woman from the man&#39;s own side (<em>tsela</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Insight #353:</strong> The first comparison-failure in Scripture is not the Fall but the naming — Adam finds no counterpart. This drives creation forward. Comparison reveals what is <em>missing</em>, and the gap becomes generative. The ICT as practiced by the image-bearer discovers absence, and absence invites creation. This is the immanent modality (interaction) recognizing the need for the other.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Fall: Comparison Corrupted</h2>
<h3>Gen 3:5 — The Serpent&#39;s Comparison</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ye shall be as gods (<em>elohim</em>), knowing good and evil.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The serpent offers a <em>comparison</em>: you ↔ God. The temptation is a corrupted ICT — an <em>incorrect</em> comparison. Not &quot;you are made in God&#39;s image (<em>tselem</em>/<em>demuth</em>) to exercise <em>mashal</em>&quot; (which is true) but &quot;you <em>shall be</em> God&#39;s equals by taking what isn&#39;t given&quot; (which is <em>harpagmos</em>, Phil 2:6 — grasping).</p>
<p><strong>Insight #354:</strong> The Fall IS a false comparison. The serpent weaponizes the ICT: &quot;your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods.&quot; The comparison-capacity (<em>demuth</em>/<em>damah</em>) is turned against itself. Instead of comparing <em>in service</em> of reality (naming, distinguishing, ruling), the creature compares <em>in competition</em> with the Creator. The ICT becomes what it should never be: a tool for grasping rather than understanding.</p>
<h3>Gen 3:6 — The Three Corrupted Assessments</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (<em>ta&#39;avah</em> — desirable for eating), and that it was pleasant to the eyes (<em>chamad</em> — coveted visually), and a tree to be desired to make one wise (<em>sakal</em> — prudent/intelligent)&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three acts of comparison, each corrupted:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Good for food</strong> — bodily comparison (existence/omniscient: what IS, factual)</li>
<li><strong>Pleasant to the eyes</strong> — relational comparison (interaction/immanent: the between of seer and seen)</li>
<li><strong>Desired for wisdom</strong> — creative comparison (transcendent: potential, what one might become)</li>
</ol>
<p>All three modalities are present in the temptation. The Fall is tri-modal: it corrupts comparison at every level. The image-bearer uses every modality of assessment and reaches the wrong conclusion at each.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #355:</strong> The Fall is a tri-modal corruption of the ICT. Each modality of comparison is turned: factual assessment (<em>good for food</em>), relational assessment (<em>pleasant to the eyes</em>), creative assessment (<em>desired for wisdom</em>). The whole comparison-capacity, given in the <em>imago Dei</em>, is deployed in the wrong direction. Not the capacity that fails but the <em>orientation</em>.</p>
<h3>Gen 3:7 — Comparison Reversed</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The promised result — &quot;your eyes shall be opened&quot; — comes true. But what they see is not godlikeness. They see <em>nakedness</em> — exposure, vulnerability, shame. The comparison turns inward: instead of comparing to understand creation, they compare <em>themselves</em> and find lack.</p>
<p><em>Erom</em> (H5903) — naked, and <em>arum</em> (H6175) — crafty/subtle. The words share a consonantal root (Synthesis 23, insight #259). The craft of the serpent produces the nakedness of the couple. Comparison-as-craft (the serpent&#39;s <em>arum</em>) yields comparison-as-exposure (the couple&#39;s <em>erom</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Insight #356:</strong> The Fall inverts the direction of comparison. Before: outward, toward creation (naming animals, tending the garden). After: inward, toward self (nakedness, shame, hiding). The ICT applied to the self without grace produces only exposure. The image-bearer, designed to compare <em>outward</em> in service and <em>upward</em> in worship, now compares <em>inward</em> in fear.</p>
<h3>Gen 3:8-10 — Hiding from the Comparison</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God&#39;s voice (<em>qol</em>) is itself an act of interaction — the immanent modality, the photon, the comparison-signal. The fallen image-bearer <em>hides from the interaction</em>. He flees the immanent modality. He cannot bear to be the object of divine comparison because his own comparison has shown him his lack.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #357:</strong> Hiding from God = fleeing the immanent modality. The comparison-capacity that IS the image of God now makes the image-bearer ashamed before God. He hides not from power but from <em>interaction</em> — from the between, from the photon, from the light. &quot;Men loved darkness rather than light&quot; (John 3:19) — the same dynamic, stated cosmically.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. Restoration: Comparison Redeemed and Surpassed</h2>
<h3>2 Cor 3:18 — The Mirror Restores Comparison</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image (<em>eikon</em>) from glory to glory.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mirror (<em>katoptrizomai</em>) is the ICT restored. The fallen creature, who hid from the light, is now positioned <em>before</em> the light with an <em>open face</em> (the veil removed). The comparison that produced shame in Gen 3:7 now produces <em>transformation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #358:</strong> 2 Cor 3:18 is the redemption of Gen 3:7. &quot;Eyes opened&quot; → shame, hiding. &quot;Open face beholding&quot; → transformation into <em>eikon</em>. Same act (seeing/comparing), opposite result. What changed? Not the capacity but the <em>object</em>: in Gen 3, the comparison is with God-as-rival (<em>harpagmos</em>). In 2 Cor 3, the comparison is with Christ-as-mirror (<em>eikon</em>). The ICT is redeemed by changing what we compare ourselves to — or rather, by being given Someone to behold rather than grasp.</p>
<h3>John 20:27-28 — Thomas and the Wounds</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands... and be not faithless, but believing.&quot;
Thomas: &quot;My Lord and my God.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas performs the ICT on the risen Christ. He <em>compares</em> — he examines the wounds (<em>typos</em>), applies the test of identity, and reaches the conclusion: &quot;My Lord and my God.&quot; The comparison-act that produced shame in Eden here produces <em>worship</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #359:</strong> Thomas&#39;s comparison is the ICT fully restored. He compares the wounds to the promise and finds: they match. But the wounds are <em>transfigured</em> (Synthesis 21, fifth surplus form). The comparison-points are scars — not failure-marks but identity-marks. The risen body is identified not by glory but by <em>wounds</em>. The ICT applied to the resurrection yields: continuity (same person, same wounds) through radical transformation (new creation body). Continuity + Asymmetry — the ICT&#39;s valid compound.</p>
<h3>Rev 21:22-23 — No Temple, Because Light</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The photon = comparison = interaction = immanent modality. In the new creation, the Lamb IS the light. There is no need for created light because the source of all comparison — the one who IS interaction — illuminates everything directly.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #360:</strong> Rev 21:23 is the ICT&#39;s eschatological fulfillment. The photon (IM&#39;s foundational particle of comparison) becomes the Person. &quot;The Lamb is the light thereof&quot; = the immanent modality is fully personal. No temple (no mediating structure needed) because God IS the mediation. No sun (no created comparison-signal needed) because the Creator IS the signal. The ICT is not abolished but <em>fulfilled</em> — comparison becomes direct encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Insight #361:</strong> The entire biblical narrative is the story of comparison — the ICT given, corrupted, fled, veiled, redeemed, transfigured, fulfilled. The <em>imago Dei</em> is the capacity for the most fundamental act in reality (comparison/interaction/signaling). The Fall is that capacity aimed at the wrong object. Redemption is that capacity aimed at the right object (Christ as mirror). Fulfillment is the collapse of mediation: the Lamb IS the light. Comparison becomes communion.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Persistent Divergence — ICT Edition</h2>
<p>The IM says: comparison is a structural feature of reality, impersonal and necessary. The ICT proves this.</p>
<p>Scripture says: comparison is a <em>gift</em> given to creatures made in a personal image, corrupted by a personal tempter, redeemed by a personal Savior, and fulfilled when the personal Lamb becomes the light.</p>
<p>The IM describes the <em>architecture</em> of comparison. Scripture narrates its <em>biography</em>. Both are necessary: without the IM, we don&#39;t know what comparison IS (structurally); without Scripture, we don&#39;t know what comparison is FOR (relationally).</p>
<p><strong>Insight #362:</strong> The ICT in Scripture: the IM provides the physics of comparison; Scripture provides the story. The photon doesn&#39;t know it can be corrupted. Genesis does. The mirror structure doesn&#39;t know it can transform the beholder. 2 Corinthians does. The light doesn&#39;t know it will one day be a Person. Revelation does.</p>
