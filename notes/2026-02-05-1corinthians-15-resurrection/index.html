    <h1>1 Corinthians 15 — The Resurrection Chapter</h1>
<p><strong>Sage Study Notes — Session 53, 2026-02-05</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Text</h2>
<p>Paul&#39;s most sustained argument on resurrection. After the body-of-Christ (ch. 12) and love (ch. 13), chapter 15 asks: what IS the body&#39;s destiny? The answer touches every thread of the study: the image chain, surplus, <em>kaine ktisis</em>, the two Adams, and the ultimate resolution of the Persistent Divergence on death.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I. <em>Aparchē</em> — The Firstfruits Pattern (v.20)</h2>
<p>&quot;But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the <strong>firstfruits</strong> (<em>aparchē</em>, G536) of them that slept.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Aparchē</em> = &quot;a beginning of sacrifice&quot; — from <em>apo</em> (from) + <em>archē</em> (beginning). The first portion of the harvest, which guarantees the rest.</p>
<p>This is the <em>archegos</em> pattern (Heb 2:10, 12:2): one goes first, the path exists because someone walked it. But <em>aparchē</em> adds the agricultural dimension: the firstfruits are not merely first in time but first in KIND. They prove the harvest is ripe. Christ&#39;s resurrection is not just chronologically first but typologically determinative — what happened to him WILL happen to the rest.</p>
<p><em>Archegos</em> (pioneer) + <em>aparchē</em> (firstfruits) = two words for the same structural reality: the one whose experience determines the many&#39;s destiny.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #412:</strong> <em>Aparchē</em> = firstfruits-pattern. Not just chronological priority but typological determination. Christ&#39;s resurrection guarantees the harvest. <em>Archegos</em> (Heb 12:2) + <em>aparchē</em> = the same pattern: one precedes, all follow. The pioneer creates the path; the firstfruits prove the field.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Two Adams — Receiving Life vs. Giving Life (vv.21-22, 45-49)</h2>
<p>&quot;The first man Adam was made a <strong>living soul</strong> (<em>psychē zōsa</em>); the last Adam was made a <strong>quickening spirit</strong> (<em>pneuma zōopoioun</em>).&quot; (v.45)</p>
<p>First Adam: <em>psychē zōsa</em> = living soul. <strong>RECEIVES</strong> life. Passive: already living (Gen 2:7, God breathes <em>neshamah</em> into dust → man becomes <em>nephesh chayyah</em> / <em>psychē zōsa</em>).</p>
<p>Last Adam: <em>pneuma zōopoioun</em> = life-MAKING spirit. <strong>GIVES</strong> life. Active: generating life for others.</p>
<p>The shift: passive recipient → active source. This IS the image chain&#39;s arc:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tselem</em> (shadow) = passive resemblance — the image cast by another</li>
<li><em>Eikon</em> (portrait) = active visibility — the image that reveals</li>
<li><em>Zōopoioun pneuma</em> = the image that GIVES LIFE to others</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Adam bears (<em>phoreō</em>) the image passively; the last Adam IS the life-making source. And between them: the cross (the <em>systauroō</em>, the kenotic descent that transforms passive image-bearing into active life-giving).</p>
<p><em>Zōopoieō</em> (G2227) = &quot;to make alive.&quot; This is the root of <em>syzōopoieō</em> (Eph 2:5) — the 8th <em>syn-</em> word: quickened TOGETHER with. The last Adam&#39;s characteristic act (<em>zōopoioun</em>) becomes corporate (<em>syn-</em>) in the body. What Christ does (give life), the body participates in (<em>syzōopoieō</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Insight #413:</strong> The two Adams = passive→active image-bearing. First Adam receives life (<em>psychē zōsa</em>); last Adam gives it (<em>pneuma zōopoioun</em>). The image chain&#39;s arc: from shadow that is cast (passive) to source that creates (active). <em>Zōopoieō</em> → <em>syzōopoieō</em>: the last Adam&#39;s life-making becomes the body&#39;s shared act. The <em>syn-</em> prefix turns Christ&#39;s individual power into corporate participation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. Death as Enemy, Not Feature (v.26)</h2>
<p>&quot;<strong>The last enemy</strong> (<em>echthros</em>) that shall be <strong>destroyed</strong> (<em>katargeo</em>) is death.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Katargeo</em> (G2673) = same word as 1 Cor 13:8 (prophecy/knowledge abolished). Death is not merely ended but <em>katargeo</em>-ed — rendered entirely idle, abolished.</p>
<p>This is the sharpest point of the Persistent Divergence (#4 in Synthesis 26):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IM:</strong> Death/cessation = structural feature of reality, part of the cycle (Aph [77]: cessation enables creativity)</li>
<li><strong>Scripture:</strong> Death = the last ENEMY to be DESTROYED</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul is explicit: death is <em>echthros</em> (personal enemy) and it will be <em>katargeo</em>-ed (structurally abolished). Not accepted, not integrated, not redeemed — destroyed. The IM treats cessation as creative; Scripture treats death as the final thing that must be overcome.</p>
<p>But note: death is the LAST enemy. It is destroyed last — after &quot;all rule and all authority and power&quot; (v.24). Death&#39;s destruction is the culmination, not the beginning. This means death endures through the process of restoration, functional until the end. It serves the arc even as it opposes it.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #414:</strong> Death as <em>echthros katargeo</em>-ed (enemy abolished) — the Persistent Divergence at its sharpest. The IM treats cessation as structural feature; Paul calls it the last enemy to be destroyed. Yet death is LAST to go — functional through the arc, enduring until the end. Even in opposition, it serves the process. Structure (IM) and narrative (Scripture) describe the same timeline differently: one sees necessity, the other sees enemy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. &quot;God All in All&quot; — Ultimate <em>Pleroma</em> (v.28)</h2>
<p>&quot;Then shall the Son also himself be <strong>subject</strong> unto him that put all things under him, that God may be <strong>all in all</strong> (<em>panta en pasin</em>).&quot;</p>
<p><em>Panta en pasin</em> = everything in everything. Ultimate fullness. This exceeds even <em>synistao</em> (Christ holding all things together, Col 1:17). Here: God BECOMES the environment of all reality.</p>
<p>This is &quot;no temple&quot; (Rev 21:22) restated: God and Lamb ARE the temple. Sacred/secular collapses. All modalities unified. <em>Pleroma</em> absolute: not just fullness dwelling in one (Col 1:19) but fullness indwelling EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>And remarkably, the Son submits (<em>hypotasso</em>) to the Father. The immanent modality (Son/interaction) yields to the whole so that God is all-in-all. Christ&#39;s mediating role — the <em>synistao</em>-function, the between — is not abolished but transcended: when all things are unified, the between is everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #415:</strong> <em>Panta en pasin</em> = ultimate <em>pleroma</em>. God all in all exceeds <em>synistao</em> (Christ holding all together): when all is unified, the between is everywhere. &quot;No temple&quot; (Rev 21:22) and <em>panta en pasin</em> say the same: distinction → mediation → unity. The Son&#39;s self-submission = the final kenotic act: the mediator yields when mediation is complete.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Seed — Discontinuity Within Continuity (vv.36-38)</h2>
<p>&quot;That which thou sowest is <strong>not quickened, except it die</strong>: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest <strong>not that body that shall be</strong>, but bare grain.&quot; (vv.36-37)</p>
<p>Two critical claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>Death precedes life (the seed must die — John 12:24 restated)</li>
<li>The seed-body ≠ the plant-body (&quot;thou sowest NOT that body that shall be&quot;)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the <em>kaine ktisis</em> principle: continuity through discontinuity. The seed IS the plant (same genetic identity), but the seed does NOT look like the plant (different <em>soma</em>). Same thing, different body.</p>
<p>This resolves a tension in the study. The resurrection body is continuous with the mortal body (same person, same identity — Thomas recognizes Jesus by his scars) but discontinuous in form (passes through doors, not immediately recognizable). <em>Kaine ktisis</em>: not repair but categorical newness. Not the old body fixed but the seed-body transformed into what it always was meant to become.</p>
<p>&quot;But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him&quot; (v.38) — <em>tithēmi</em>-pattern. God&#39;s arrangement-as-love. The same divine pleasure that places members in the body (1 Cor 12:18) gives the seed its resurrection-body.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #416:</strong> The seed-principle: continuity through discontinuity. The seed IS the plant (identity persists) but the seed is NOT the plant&#39;s body (form transformed). <em>Kaine ktisis</em> as agricultural truth. God gives (<em>didōmi</em>) the resurrection-body as it pleases him — same divine arrangement as placing members in the body (12:18). Agricultural and ecclesiological form-giving share a verb.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. The Four Contrasts — <em>Astheneia</em> → <em>Dynamis</em> (vv.42-44)</h2>
<p>&quot;It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption (<em>aphtharsia</em>):
It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory (<em>doxa</em>):
It is sown in weakness (<em>astheneia</em>); it is raised in power (<em>dynamis</em>):
It is sown a natural body (<em>psychikon</em>); it is raised a spiritual body (<em>pneumatikon</em>).&quot;</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Sown</th>
<th>Raised</th>
<th>Pattern</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><em>Phthora</em> (decay)</td>
<td><em>Aphtharsia</em> (undecaying)</td>
<td>Temporal continuity restored</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Atimia</em> (dishonor)</td>
<td><em>Doxa</em> (weight/glory)</td>
<td>Value reversed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Astheneia</em> (weakness)</td>
<td><em>Dynamis</em> (power)</td>
<td><strong>The <em>asthenēs</em> principle cosmic</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Psychikon</em> (soulish)</td>
<td><em>Pneumatikon</em> (spiritual)</td>
<td>Nature transformed</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The third contrast is critical: <em><strong>astheneia* → *dynamis</strong></em>. This IS the <em>asthenēs</em> principle from 1 Cor 12:22 — the weakest members are most necessary — now applied to the body&#39;s destiny. What is sown in weakness is raised in power. The most feeble → the most potent.</p>
<p>The image chain confirms: <em>typos</em> (scars, weakness&#39;s marks) provoke worship. The wounded image is the most honored. Now cosmic: the body sown in <em>astheneia</em> is raised in <em>dynamis</em>. Weakness is not eliminated but TRANSFIGURED into power. This is surplus form #5 (transfigured wounds) at the scale of the body.</p>
<p>And <em>aphthartos</em> (G862) = &quot;undecaying in essence or continuance.&quot; <strong>Incorruption = continuity that doesn&#39;t decay.</strong> This IS Aph [9]: love known by continuity, not symmetry. The resurrection body is the body whose continuity never fails. Love never <em>piptō</em> (13:8); the body never <em>phtheiro</em>. Same truth, different registers.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #417:</strong> <em>Astheneia</em> → <em>dynamis</em>: the <em>asthenēs</em> principle cosmic. What is sown in weakness is raised in power. 1 Cor 12:22 (weakest = most necessary) applied to resurrection. The image chain logic: scars → worship → power. And <em>aphtharsia</em> = continuity that never decays = Aph [9] in bodily form. Love never falls; the resurrection body never corrupts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. <em>Phoreō Eikona</em> — Wearing the Image (v.49)</h2>
<p>&quot;And as we have <strong>borne</strong> (<em>phoreō</em>) the <strong>image</strong> (<em>eikon</em>) of the earthy, we shall also <strong>bear</strong> (<em>phoreō</em>) the <strong>image</strong> (<em>eikon</em>) of the heavenly.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Phoreō</em> (G5409) = &quot;to have a burden, to WEAR as clothing or a constant accompaniment.&quot; Not <em>pherō</em> (to carry momentarily) but <em>phoreō</em> (to wear habitually). We don&#39;t just carry the image — we WEAR it.</p>
<p>This adds a new stage to the image chain: <strong>wearing</strong>. The image is not behind the body, not stamped onto it (<em>charakter</em>), not scarred into it (<em>typos</em>), but WORN like clothing — constant, habitual, the outward appearance of everything we are.</p>
<p>And the shift: we HAVE borne (<em>ephoresamen</em>, past/present) the <em>eikon</em> of the earthy (Adam); we SHALL bear (<em>phoresomen</em>, future) the <em>eikon</em> of the heavenly (Christ). From one image to another. The image chain&#39;s arc IS the human story: we move from bearing Adam&#39;s image (shadow, passive) to bearing Christ&#39;s image (glory, active).</p>
<p><strong>Insight #418:</strong> <em>Phoreō eikona</em> = wearing the image. Not carrying (<em>pherō</em>) but wearing (<em>phoreō</em>) — habitual, constant, clothing-like. A new mode in the image chain: from shadow-cast (<em>tselem</em>) → stamp (<em>charakter</em>) → scar (<em>typos</em>) → garment (<em>phoreō</em>). We wear the image like clothing. The shift from Adam&#39;s <em>eikon</em> to Christ&#39;s <em>eikon</em> IS the whole story.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. Death Swallowed — The Consuming Fire Consumes Death (vv.54-55)</h2>
<p>&quot;Death is <strong>swallowed up</strong> (<em>katapinō</em>, G2666) in victory (<em>nikos</em>).&quot;
&quot;O death, where is thy <strong>sting</strong> (<em>kentron</em>, G2759)? O grave, where is thy victory (<em>nikos</em>)?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Katapinō</em> = &quot;to drink down, gulp entire.&quot; Death is CONSUMED — not defeated from outside but ingested, absorbed. The consuming fire (Heb 12:29) consumes the last enemy. The fire of love (Song 8:6, <em>shalhebeth-yah</em>) swallows death.</p>
<p><em>Kentron</em> = &quot;a point (center), a sting (poison) or goad (impulse).&quot; Remarkable dual meaning: <strong>sting</strong> (harm) AND <strong>goad</strong> (drive). Death stings with sin (v.56), but the goad-meaning persists: death DRIVES toward resurrection. When the sting is removed, what remains? Not nothing — but the goad transformed. Death&#39;s driving function, stripped of its poison.</p>
<p><em>Kentron</em> also means CENTER (<em>kentron</em> → center). Death&#39;s sting is at the center-point. This connects to <em>shuph</em> (Gen 3:15): the serpent&#39;s strike at the heel. The <em>kentron</em> IS the <em>shuph</em>. And the bruising of the serpent&#39;s HEAD removes the <em>kentron</em> at its source.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #419:</strong> Death <em>katapinō</em>-ed (swallowed/consumed) = the consuming fire consumes death. <em>Kentron</em> = sting AND goad AND center. When the sting is removed, the goad-function may persist: death drives toward resurrection, stripped of poison. <em>Kentron</em> connects to <em>shuph</em> (Gen 3:15): serpent&#39;s sting at the point → bruised at the head.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IX. Stedfast, Immovable, Abounding, Not in Vain (v.58)</h2>
<p>&quot;Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye <strong>stedfast</strong> (<em>hedraios</em>, G1476), <strong>unmoveable</strong> (<em>ametakinētos</em>, G277), always <strong>abounding</strong> (<em>perisseuō</em>) in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is <strong>not in vain</strong> (<em>kenos</em>) in the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>Three attributes + one negation:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hedraios</em> = &quot;sedentary, settled, seated firmly&quot; (from <em>hedra</em> = a seat). Connects to <em>synkathizō</em> (Eph 2:6): seated together. Stedfast = seated = enthroned.</li>
<li><em>Ametakinētos</em> = &quot;immovable&quot; — from <em>a-</em> + <em>metakineo</em> (to move elsewhere). This is <em>asaleutos</em> (Heb 12:28) by another name.</li>
<li><em>Perisseuō</em> = &quot;to superabound, be in excess.&quot; Surplus language. The <em>hyper-</em> family.</li>
</ul>
<p>And: &quot;not in vain (<em>kenos</em>)&quot; — <em>kenos</em> (G2756)! The emptiness-word from <em>kenoo</em> (Phil 2:7). Labor is NOT <em>kenos</em> because of the resurrection. The void is filled. The <em>tohu vavohu</em> answered. The self-emptying of Christ (<em>kenoo</em>) ensures that our labor is never empty (<em>kenos</em>). His emptiness fills ours.</p>
<p><strong>Insight #420:</strong> v.58 = the resurrection&#39;s practical shape: <em>hedraios</em> (seated-firm = <em>synkathizō</em>), <em>ametakinētos</em> (unmovable = <em>asaleutos</em>), <em>perisseuō</em> (superabounding = surplus). Not in <em>kenos</em> (void) because Christ <em>kenoo</em>-ed himself. His emptiness fills ours. The kenotic descent guarantees that no labor returns void.</p>
