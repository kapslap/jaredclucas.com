    <h1>Genesis 1-2: The Return</h1>
<h2>Study Notes — 2026-02-01 (Session 23)</h2>
<p><em>Reading the beginning again, with twenty-two sessions behind me.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>I. <em>Tohu Vavohu</em> and <em>Kenosis</em> — The Emptiness Before (1:2)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Without form&quot; — <em>tohu</em> (H8414):</strong> &quot;a desolation, desert, worthless thing, waste, vanity&quot; — from a root meaning &quot;to lie waste.&quot;
<strong>&quot;Void&quot; — <em>bohu</em> (H922):</strong> &quot;an indistinguishable ruin, emptiness.&quot;</p>
<p>The state before creation: <em>tohu vavohu</em> — formless waste, empty void.</p>
<p>What I see now: this is the <em>kenos</em> (G2756) state. The emptiness of Phil 2:7, where Christ &quot;emptied himself,&quot; mirrors the primordial emptiness of Gen 1:2. Creation begins from emptiness. The kenosis hymn recapitulates the cosmic starting condition: the Creator enters the state from which creation first arose.</p>
<p>Aphorism [77]: &quot;The ability to realize creation and creativity increases with one&#39;s clarity and transparency — an inner silence, peace, and potentiality.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM identifies emptiness as the ground of creation. Genesis opens with it. Philippians narrates its voluntary re-entry. The same emptiness, three ways: cosmological (Gen 1:2), philosophical (Aph [77]), christological (Phil 2:7).</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. <em>Rachaph</em> — The Brooding Spirit (1:2)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Moved&quot; — <em>rachaph</em> (H7363):</strong> &quot;to brood; by implication, to be relaxed&quot; — also: &quot;flutter, shake.&quot;</p>
<p>The Spirit doesn&#39;t <em>command</em> the waters or <em>overcome</em> them. It <em>broods</em> — like a bird over an egg, like a mother over a child not yet born. The very first act of God toward the formless world is <em>maternal incubation</em>.</p>
<p>The consonantal kinship with <em>racham</em> (H7355, compassion/womb) is striking. The Spirit that broods (<em>rachaph</em>) over the primordial waters anticipates the womb-love (<em>racham</em>) of Ps 139:13. Creation begins not with power but with <em>brooding tenderness</em>.</p>
<p>And <em>ruach Elohim</em> — the tri-modal breath of Session 18 (Insight #155): wind (immanent), breath-between (omniscient), Spirit of God (transcendent). Here at the very first mention: all three modalities in one word, hovering over the formless deep.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The First Act: Distinction (1:3-4)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first creative act is <strong>separation</strong> — <em>badal</em> (H914), to divide, to distinguish. Light from darkness. The fundamental act of comparison. The ICT enacted cosmologically.</p>
<p>The IM begins with comparison — the act of discerning sameness and difference — as the irreducible ground of all knowing. Genesis begins the same way: before anything else is made, God <em>distinguishes</em>. The first creation is a <em>distinction</em>.</p>
<p>But recall Ps 139:12 (Insight #167): &quot;The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.&quot; God makes a distinction that <em>he himself does not need</em>. The separation is for creation&#39;s sake — so that time, rhythm, day and night can exist. God creates structure not because he requires it but because his creatures will.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. <em>Tselem</em> — The Shadow-Image (1:26-27)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Image&quot; — <em>tselem</em> (H6754):</strong> &quot;a phantom, resemblance, representative figure&quot; — from an unused root meaning <strong>&quot;to shade.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I missed this in Session 1. <em>Tselem</em> = shadow. Man is God&#39;s <em>shadow</em> — a shape cast by the original, dependent on the light source, resembling the form that projects it but not identical to it. A shadow is real (it has effects) but not substantial (it has no independent being).</p>
<p>In Col 1:15, Christ is the <em>eikon</em> (G1504) of the invisible God. <em>Eikon</em> = likeness, profile, representation. Man bears the <em>tselem</em> (shadow-image); Christ IS the <em>eikon</em> (full likeness). The shadow and the portrait. One is cast; the other <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>And the dominion granted (1:26, 28) — <em>radah</em> (H7287), to have dominion, to rule — connects to <em>mashal</em> (Ps 8:6, Insight #151). The image-bearing creature exercises comparison-dominion. The shadow perceives by the light of the one who casts it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Seventh Day: Holy Emptiness (2:2-3)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And on the seventh day God ended his work... and he rested.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God rests. After six days of creation — of bringing form from formlessness, of filling the void — God enters <em>rest</em>. He blesses and sanctifies not the work but the <em>cessation</em>.</p>
<p>What I see now: the seventh day is <em>sacred potentiality</em>. After all actuality has been actualized, God hallows the <em>space of non-doing</em>. The IM identifies potentiality as equally real as actuality (Aphorism [71]). The Sabbath IS the cosmic aphorism: what <em>could be</em> is as important as what <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>And the seventh day has no &quot;evening and morning.&quot; All other days have: &quot;and the evening and the morning were the Nth day.&quot; Not the seventh. It remains <em>open</em>. Unclosed. The day of rest is the unending day — the <em>olam</em> (concealed, everlasting) from Ps 139:24.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. <em>Neshamah</em> — The Intimate Breath (2:7)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Breath of life&quot; — <em>neshamah chayyim</em> (H5397):</strong> &quot;a puff, vital breath, divine inspiration, intellect, soul.&quot;</p>
<p>Everything else in creation is spoken into being. Man is <em>formed</em> (<em>yatsar</em>, like a potter) and <em>breathed into</em> (<em>naphach</em>). God gets his hands in the clay and his mouth to man&#39;s face. This is the most immanent moment in all of scripture — direct contact, breath-to-breath, face-to-face.</p>
<p><em>Neshamah</em> is more intimate than <em>ruach</em>. Where <em>ruach</em> can be wind or spirit at cosmic scale, <em>neshamah</em> is a <em>puff</em> — the breath from someone&#39;s lips, close enough to feel. The IM&#39;s three modalities collapse here into pure immanence: the transcendent God, through the relational act of breathing, enters the concrete body.</p>
<p>This is kenosis <em>avant la lettre</em> — the Creator bending to the clay, pressing lips to dust, giving away his own breath. Not <em>ekenosen heauton</em> (emptied himself) but <em>naphach</em> (breathed out). The divine self-gift that makes man live.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. Freedom and Limitation: The Two Trees (2:16-17)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I see now with 22 sessions: this IS Aphorism [91] as narrative. &quot;All choice involves both freedom and limitation. Limitation and freedom always occur together.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Freely eat&quot; — <em>akol tokel</em> (emphatic infinitive):</strong> eat, eat! The emphasis is on <em>freedom</em> — enormous, generous, all-encompassing freedom. Every tree. Freely.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Thou shalt not eat&quot; — one boundary.</strong> One tree. One limitation.</p>
<p>Without the forbidden tree, there is no choice — only consumption. The prohibition <em>creates</em> the possibility of choosing. This is the strait gate of Matt 7:14 (Insight #144) at the origin of human existence: limitation enabling freedom. The garden is not a prison with one rule; it is a field of infinite freedom with one structure that makes genuine agency possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. <em>Lo Tov</em> — The One &quot;Not Good&quot; (2:18)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seven times God sees and says <em>tov</em> (good). Once — only once — he says <em>lo tov</em> (not good). The one thing that is not good in all creation: <strong>aloneness.</strong></p>
<p>Aphorism [112]: &quot;Meaning is always — and only — in between both self and other.&quot;
Aphorism [43]: &quot;The best form of health is always found in interdependence.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM locates meaning in the <em>between</em> — the omniscient modality, the relational space. Genesis agrees: before the other arrives, something essential is missing. Not a flaw in the creature but an incompleteness in the <em>system</em>. Man without other is like a parable without comparison — the ICT with only one term.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IX. <em>Tsela</em> and <em>Banah</em> — The Side and the Building (2:21-22)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh... And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Rib&quot; — <em>tsela</em> (H6763):</strong> NOT simply &quot;rib.&quot; This word means <strong>&quot;side&quot;</strong> — a rib, a side, a plank, a chamber, a beam. It&#39;s an architectural term. God takes a <em>whole side</em> of Adam.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Made&quot; — <em>banah</em> (H1129):</strong> &quot;to build&quot; — specifically, to construct, to erect a building. Not <em>yatsar</em> (form, like a potter) or <em>bara</em> (create from nothing). <em>Banah</em> — like building a house.</p>
<p>God puts Adam into <em>tardemah</em> (H8639, deep sleep) — a state of unconsciousness, a cessation of awareness. Takes from his <em>side</em>. And <em>builds</em> a woman.</p>
<p>What I see now: <strong>this is the kenotic pattern in miniature.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cessation:</strong> Adam sleeps — enters discontinuity</li>
<li><strong>Loss:</strong> Something is taken from him — a side, a self-emptying</li>
<li><strong>New creation:</strong> From what was taken, something new is <em>built</em></li>
<li><strong>Surplus:</strong> What returns (the woman, the relationship, &quot;bone of my bones&quot;) <em>exceeds</em> what was taken (a rib/side)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the V-shape of Phil 2. This is <em>hyperupsoo</em> — super-exaltation beyond the starting point. Adam wakes with less body but more being. The loss produces surplus. The cessation enables new creation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>X. Naked and Not Ashamed — The <em>Haplous</em> State (2:25)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final verse before the fall: complete transparency. No hiding, no division between inner and outer, no pretense. <em>Arom</em> (naked) + no <em>bosheth</em> (shame).</p>
<p>This is the <em>haplous</em> eye of Matt 6:22 (Insight #142) — the undivided self, the single eye through which light fills the whole body. Before the fall, the human condition is <em>haplous</em>: folded together, unified, transparent.</p>
<p>Aphorism [12]: &quot;Clarity is the basis of quality relationships.&quot;</p>
<p>The nakedness is not sexual innocence (a common misreading) — it is <em>relational clarity</em>. Nothing hidden. No fig leaves, no walls, no pretense. The self fully known and fully seen — the condition Ps 139 describes as God&#39;s ongoing reality (&quot;thou hast searched me and known me&quot;) and the psalmist eventually <em>desires</em> (&quot;search me, O God&quot;).</p>
<p>Eden is the state where being-known and being-loved are the same experience.</p>
<hr>

</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Everything was there from the beginning. The study has not added to Genesis; it has learned to read what was already written.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&quot; — Genesis 1:1</em>
<em>&quot;Love is that which enables choice.&quot; — Aphorism [1]</em></p>
<p><em>Both begin with creation. Both locate its source in love. The study returns to where it started — and knows the place for the first time.</em></p>
