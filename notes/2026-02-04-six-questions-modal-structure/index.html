    <h1>The Six Fundamental Questions — Modal Structure</h1>
<p><strong>Session 61 — 2026-02-04</strong></p>
<p><em>Jared&#39;s question via Tillerman: How do the six fundamental questions — Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How — relate to each other within the IM framework?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>I. The Structure: A 2×3 Matrix</h2>
<p>The six questions are not a flat list. They are a <strong>2×3 matrix</strong> — three modalities crossed with two aspects of reality:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Immanent</strong> (Interaction)</th>
<th><strong>Omniscient</strong> (Existence)</th>
<th><strong>Transcendent</strong> (Creation)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Existence</strong></td>
<td><strong>WHO</strong></td>
<td><strong>WHAT</strong></td>
<td><strong>WHERE</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Process</strong></td>
<td><strong>HOW</strong></td>
<td><strong>WHEN</strong></td>
<td><strong>WHY</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Each modality has two faces: what it IS (existence) and what it DOES (process). The six questions are the six faces of reality&#39;s cube.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Assignments</h2>
<h3>WHO = Immanent / Existence</h3>
<p>Who you ARE is relational. &quot;Who am I?&quot; (Exod 3:11) can only be answered in terms of relationships, roles, identity-in-context. The self is not a substance but an interaction. Hebrew <em>mi</em> (H4310) is an &quot;interrogative pronoun of persons&quot; — specifically for persons, irreducible to things. The WHO question stands alone, primitive, underived. Like the immanent modality: the origin, the middle, the most fundamental.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Goodness in self&quot;</strong> — who you are IS your goodness. Identity is moral and relational, not factual.</p>
<h3>WHAT = Omniscient / Existence</h3>
<p>What something IS, factually. Content, substance, the thing itself. &quot;What is man, that thou art mindful of him?&quot; (Ps 8:4). Hebrew <em>mah</em> (H4100) = &quot;properly, interrogative what?&quot; — but remarkably, Strong&#39;s notes it includes &quot;how? why? when?&quot; within its semantic range. The WHAT question is the visible face of inquiry from which the other process-questions can be derived. Like the omniscient modality: the domain of facts, the knowable, from which other knowledge proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Truth in world&quot;</strong> — what exists IS the truth. Facts are the world&#39;s testimony about itself.</p>
<h3>WHERE = Transcendent / Existence</h3>
<p>Where something exists — the context, the formal space, the structure that CONTAINS. <em>Gan</em> (garden) = fenced space. <em>Olam</em> = the hidden way. WHERE establishes the formal conditions within which existence and interaction can occur. The transcendent creates the space; WHERE asks about that space.</p>
<p>Hebrew <em>ayyeh</em> (H346) derives from <em>ay</em> (H335) = &quot;where? hence how?&quot; — a root shared with <em>eikh</em> (how). Location and method spring from the same inquiry (see §IV below).</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Beauty in other&quot;</strong> — where the other stands IS the source of beauty. Context is given by what transcends you.</p>
<h3>HOW = Immanent / Process</h3>
<p>How does the interaction proceed? Method, means, the dynamics of relationship. Axiom II — the processual axiom — has <strong>immanent nature</strong>. The HOW question IS Axiom II applied to inquiry: asking about the process of becoming, the mode of interaction.</p>
<p>Thomas asks: &quot;How can we know the way?&quot; (John 14:5). Jesus answers not with a method but with a Person: &quot;I am the way.&quot; The HOW question, at its deepest, is answered by the WHO.</p>
<h3>WHEN = Omniscient / Process</h3>
<p>When does it happen? The factual temporal coordinate — the moment that IS. Time as objective existence. Hebrew <em>mathay</em> (H4970) = from a root meaning &quot;to extend.&quot; Time is stretched existence — existence in its processual aspect.</p>
<p>&quot;To every thing there is a season&quot; (Ecc 3:1). The WHEN is given by the structure of existence itself.</p>
<h3>WHY = Transcendent / Process</h3>
<p>Why does it happen? Purpose, <em>telos</em>, creative intention — the question that reaches beyond what IS to what COULD BE or SHOULD BE. The transcendent domain: creation, potential, the generative.</p>
<p>Hebrew <em>maddua</em> (H4069) = from <em>mah</em> (H4100, what) + <em>yada</em> (H3045, to know). <strong>WHY is literally constructed from WHAT + KNOWING.</strong> Purpose arises at the intersection of existence (omniscient) and relational knowledge (immanent). The Hebrew language encodes the Axiom II ring in the etymology of &quot;why&quot;: Omniscient (<em>mah</em>) + Immanent (<em>yada</em>) → Transcendent (<em>maddua</em>). Many facts relationally known → one purpose discerned.</p>
<p>And the most devastating question in Scripture is a WHY: &quot;My God, my God, <strong>why</strong> hast thou forsaken me?&quot; (Matt 27:46). The transcendent question — asked from the cross. The deepest suffering asks for the deepest meaning. And it receives... silence. The unknowable. Axiom III: the transcendent always retains something beyond reach.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. The Three Axioms Applied</h2>
<h3>Axiom I: WHO/HOW Are Most Fundamental</h3>
<p>The immanent pair (Who/How) is more fundamental than the omniscient pair (What/When) or the transcendent pair (Where/Why).</p>
<p><strong>You must know WHO is asking before WHAT or WHERE can have meaning.</strong> Identity precedes content. The person precedes the fact.</p>
<p>Scripture confirms this with remarkable consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>God&#39;s first question to fallen humanity is relational, not factual.</strong> &quot;Where art thou?&quot; (Gen 3:9) is not a location query — God knows where Adam is. It is a WHO question disguised as WHERE: <em>Who have you become? Where do you stand in relation to me?</em> The WHERE is immanent (relational position), not omniscient (GPS coordinates).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Moses asks WHO before WHAT.</strong> &quot;Who am I?&quot; (Exod 3:11) precedes &quot;What is his name?&quot; (Exod 3:13). Identity precedes content.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>God answers WHAT with WHO.</strong> &quot;What is his name?&quot; receives &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; (<em>ehyeh asher ehyeh</em>). The omniscient question (what is the content?) is answered with the immanent reality (I AM — pure relational being). God refuses the WHAT and gives the WHO. Because the WHO is more fundamental.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pilate asks WHAT; Truth stands before him.</strong> &quot;What is truth?&quot; (John 18:38). The omniscient question. Asked by a man who has the WHO standing right in front of him but cannot see. The WHAT question fails precisely because the WHO has not been recognized. You cannot know what truth is until you know who truth is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;The greatest is love&quot; (1 Cor 13:13) = the WHO/HOW pair governs all.</strong> Who loves, and how they love, determines everything else. Without love (<em>agapē</em> = the HOW of interaction), all knowledge (WHAT) = nothing, all prophecy (WHEN/WHY) = nothing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Axiom II: The Ring Turns Among the Pairs</h3>
<p>Within each row and between them, the Axiom II cycle holds:</p>
<p><strong>Existence row: WHO → WHAT → WHERE → WHO</strong>
You identify the agent (who) → determine the content (what) → understand the context (where) → and return to deeper understanding of the agent (who is now known differently).</p>
<p><strong>Process row: HOW → WHEN → WHY → HOW</strong>
You observe the method (how) → note the timing (when) → discern the purpose (why) → the purpose reveals a new method (how changes in light of why).</p>
<p><strong>Between rows (the vertical connections):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHO ↔ HOW</strong>: Identity determines method; method reveals identity. <em>&quot;By their fruits ye shall know them&quot;</em> (Matt 7:20). Who you are IS how you act.</li>
<li><strong>WHAT ↔ WHEN</strong>: Content determines timing; timing reveals content. The seed determines the season. <em>&quot;To every thing there is a season&quot;</em> (Ecc 3:1).</li>
<li><strong>WHERE ↔ WHY</strong>: Context determines purpose; purpose shapes context. Where you stand determines what you can see. <em>&quot;In my Father&#39;s house are many mansions... I go to prepare a place&quot;</em> (John 14:2). The WHY (to prepare) creates the WHERE (the place).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Axiom III: Distinct, Inseparable, Non-Interchangeable</h3>
<p>You cannot reduce WHO to WHAT. Persons are not things. The <em>mi</em> question and the <em>mah</em> question are separate Hebrew words from separate roots.</p>
<p>You cannot reduce HOW to WHEN. Method is not timing. The way you do something is not the moment you do it.</p>
<p>You cannot reduce WHERE to WHY. Location is not purpose. The garden is not the same as the reason for the garden.</p>
<p>And yet every complete account requires all six. A story without WHO is impersonal. Without WHAT, contentless. Without WHERE, ungrounded. Without WHEN, timeless. Without WHY, meaningless. Without HOW, abstract. The six are always distinct, always inseparable — like the three modalities themselves, doubled.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Hebrew Evidence: Root Structures</h2>
<p>The Hebrew language encodes the modal structure of the six questions in its own etymology:</p>
<h3><em>Mi</em> (WHO) = Primitive, Irreducible</h3>
<p>H4310 — stands alone. Not derived from other roots. The person-question is foundational, underived. Like the immanent modality: the origin.</p>
<h3><em>Mah</em> (WHAT) = Primitive but Generative</h3>
<p>H4100 — also stands alone, but Strong&#39;s notes its range includes &quot;how? why? when?&quot; The existence-question <em>contains the seeds of the process-questions</em>. From the omniscient domain, the other questions can be generated — but they are not reducible to it. WHAT generates WHY because purpose arises from examining what exists. But WHY is not merely WHAT.</p>
<h3><em>Ay</em> Root = WHERE and HOW Share a Source</h3>
<p>H335 <em>ay</em> = &quot;where? hence how?&quot; H346 <em>ayyeh</em> (where) and H349 <em>eikh</em> (how) both derive from this root. <strong>Location and method spring from the same inquiry.</strong> In the matrix, WHERE = transcendent/existence and HOW = immanent/process — they sit diagonally. Their shared root suggests they are two faces of one deeper question: <em>What is the position?</em> — statically (where) or dynamically (how). The <em>ay</em> root is the query about ORIENTATION.</p>
<p>This diagonal connection (transcendent-existence ↔ immanent-process) is structurally significant. It&#39;s the line from WHERE to HOW — from the given context to the method of engagement. &quot;Where art thou?&quot; immediately implies &quot;How will you respond?&quot; The <em>ay</em>-root question is the hinge between being and doing.</p>
<h3><em>Maddua</em> (WHY) = WHAT + KNOWING</h3>
<p>H4069 — derived from <em>mah</em> (H4100, what) + <em>yada</em> (H3045, to know). <strong>Purpose = existence + relational engagement.</strong> The WHY question is CONSTRUCTED from omniscient (facts) + immanent (knowing/relating). This IS the Axiom II ring in etymology:</p>
<p>Omniscient (<em>mah</em>) + Immanent (<em>yada</em>) → Transcendent (<em>maddua</em>)</p>
<p>Many facts, relationally known, yield one purpose. The Hebrew language PROVES that purpose is not primitive but emergent from the intersection of existence and interaction.</p>
<h3><em>Mathay</em> (WHEN) = Extension</h3>
<p>H4970 — from a root meaning &quot;to extend.&quot; Time as stretched existence. WHEN is existence in its processual form — not content but duration.</p>

<h2>V. God&#39;s Questions — The Biblical Sequence</h2>
<p>God&#39;s first five questions to humanity (Gen 3-4) follow a pattern:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Verse</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Modality</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Gen 3:9</td>
<td>&quot;Where art thou?&quot;</td>
<td>WHERE (as relational WHO)</td>
<td>Immanent disguised as Transcendent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gen 3:11</td>
<td>&quot;Who told thee?&quot;</td>
<td>WHO</td>
<td>Immanent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gen 3:13</td>
<td>&quot;What is this thou hast done?&quot;</td>
<td>WHAT</td>
<td>Omniscient</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gen 4:9</td>
<td>&quot;Where is Abel?&quot;</td>
<td>WHERE (relational)</td>
<td>Immanent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gen 4:10</td>
<td>&quot;What hast thou done?&quot;</td>
<td>WHAT</td>
<td>Omniscient</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The pattern: <strong>WHERE (relational) → WHO → WHAT → WHERE (relational) → WHAT.</strong></p>
<p>God begins with relational position (immanent), moves to identity (immanent), then to content (omniscient). He never asks WHY or WHEN of the fallen. The transcendent question — purpose — is not asked of those who have broken the ring. And notably, both WHERE questions (3:9, 4:9) are relational, not spatial. God knows the location; he&#39;s asking about the relationship. Even the WHERE is functioning as a WHO/HOW question: <em>Where do you stand with me? How did you get here?</em></p>
<p>At the burning bush, Moses asks the reverse sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;<strong>Who</strong> am I?&quot; (3:11) — Immanent</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>What</strong> is his name?&quot; (3:13) — Omniscient</li>
<li>God answers: &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot; — <strong>WHO absorbs WHAT.</strong> The immanent swallows the omniscient. Identity IS content.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the cross, the only question is:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;<strong>Why</strong> hast thou forsaken me?&quot; (Matt 27:46) — <strong>Transcendent</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The deepest moment asks the deepest question. The WHY from the cross reaches into the unknowable. And the answer is three days of silence — the transcendent always retaining something beyond the boundary of the knowable (Axiom III).</p>
<p>Then at the tomb-garden, the risen Christ asks:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Woman, <strong>why</strong> weepest thou? <strong>Whom</strong> seekest thou?&quot; (John 20:15) — <strong>Transcendent → Immanent</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The resurrection restores the ring. WHY (the unanswered question of the cross) meets WHOM (the relational question). Purpose meets Person. The transcendent loops back to the immanent. The ring turns again.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. The ICT Applied to Inquiry</h2>
<p>Every question IS a comparison act. The ICT&#39;s three comparison-intrinsics map to the three question-pairs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ICT Intrinsic</th>
<th>Modality</th>
<th>Question Pair</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Content / Subject</strong></td>
<td>Immanent</td>
<td>WHO / HOW — comparing agents and methods</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sameness / Difference</strong></td>
<td>Omniscient</td>
<td>WHAT / WHEN — assessing facts and times</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Context / Object</strong></td>
<td>Transcendent</td>
<td>WHERE / WHY — examining contexts and purposes</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To ask WHO is to compare subjects. To ask WHAT is to assess sameness and difference (&quot;What IS it?&quot; = categorizing by comparison). To ask WHERE is to examine the context within which comparison occurs.</p>
<p>And the ICT constraint applies: <strong>you cannot fully answer the immanent questions (Who/How) and the omniscient questions (What/When) simultaneously and fundamentally.</strong> Continuity (of relationship/identity) and symmetry (of factual knowledge) cannot both be maximally held. The more precisely you know WHAT something is, the less you know WHO it is in relationship.</p>
<p>This is the study&#39;s own experience. The IM answers WHAT with extraordinary precision. Scripture answers WHO with devastating intimacy. Together they turn the ring. Apart, each is incomplete.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. The Good/True/Beautiful Correspondence</h2>
<p>The six questions map through the Good/True/Beautiful triple (Session 60):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Quality</th>
<th>Modality</th>
<th>Existence Question</th>
<th>Process Question</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Goodness</strong> (in self)</td>
<td>Immanent</td>
<td>WHO am I?</td>
<td>HOW do I act?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Truth</strong> (in world)</td>
<td>Omniscient</td>
<td>WHAT exists?</td>
<td>WHEN does it occur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Beauty</strong> (in other)</td>
<td>Transcendent</td>
<td>WHERE is the context?</td>
<td>WHY is it purposed?</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goodness answers Who/How</strong>: The good is known in the self through identity and method. &quot;The good shepherd giveth his life&quot; — Who he is determines How he acts.</li>
<li><strong>Truth answers What/When</strong>: The true is known in the world through facts and timing. &quot;What is truth?&quot; asks about existence; truth IS what stands firm (<em>emeth</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Beauty answers Where/Why</strong>: The beautiful is encountered in the other through context and purpose. &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God&quot; — the Where (creation&#39;s context) reveals the Why (God&#39;s purpose), and the revelation is beautiful.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. One Structure, Six Faces</h2>
<p>The six fundamental questions are not a list but a <strong>crystal</strong> — a single structure with six faces, each opening onto a different aspect of reality.</p>
<p>Three modalities (Immanent, Omniscient, Transcendent) × two aspects (Existence, Process) = six questions.</p>
<p>Axiom I says the immanent pair is most fundamental: <strong>WHO and HOW</strong> govern all inquiry. Know the agent and the method; the rest follows.</p>
<p>Axiom II says they cycle: WHO → WHAT → WHERE → WHO (existence ring). HOW → WHEN → WHY → HOW (process ring). And between: WHO↔HOW, WHAT↔WHEN, WHERE↔WHY.</p>
<p>Axiom III says they are distinct and inseparable: no question reduces to another, no account is complete without all six.</p>
<p>The Hebrew language confirms the structure: <em>mi</em> (who) is primitive and irreducible. <em>Mah</em> (what) generates but does not contain. <em>Ay</em> (where/how) shares a root across existence and process. <em>Maddua</em> (why) is constructed from <em>mah</em> + <em>yada</em> — the Axiom II ring in etymology.</p>
<p>And Scripture traces the questions through sacred history: from God&#39;s first relational WHERE (Gen 3:9), through Moses&#39; WHO and WHAT at the bush, to Christ&#39;s devastating WHY on the cross, to the risen Lord&#39;s restored WHY + WHOM at the tomb. The ring of questions IS the ring of redemption.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IX. Insights</h2>
<ol start="477">
<li><p><strong>The six questions form a 2×3 matrix: three modalities × two aspects (existence/process).</strong> WHO/HOW = immanent. WHAT/WHEN = omniscient. WHERE/WHY = transcendent. Not a list but a crystal with six faces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>WHO and HOW are most fundamental (Axiom I applied to inquiry).</strong> You must know the agent and the method before content, timing, context, or purpose can have meaning. Hebrew <em>mi</em> (who) is primitive and irreducible — like the immanent modality itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrew <em>maddua</em> (why) = <em>mah</em> (what) + <em>yada</em> (to know) = the Axiom II ring in etymology.</strong> Purpose is constructed from existence + relational knowing. Omniscient + Immanent → Transcendent. The Hebrew language PROVES purpose is emergent, not primitive.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrew <em>ay</em> roots both WHERE (<em>ayyeh</em>) and HOW (<em>eikh</em>).</strong> Location and method share a source — the query about orientation, static or dynamic. The diagonal of the matrix (transcendent/existence ↔ immanent/process) has a linguistic bridge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>God answers WHAT with WHO: &quot;I AM THAT I AM.&quot;</strong> The omniscient question (What is his name?) receives the immanent answer (I AM — pure relational being). Identity absorbs content. The WHO is more fundamental than the WHAT.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pilate&#39;s failure is a question-modality error.</strong> &quot;What is truth?&quot; (omniscient) asked while WHO-is-truth stands before him. The WHAT question fails because the WHO has not been recognized. You cannot know WHAT truth is until you know WHO truth is.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Christ&#39;s cry from the cross is the transcendent question — WHY.</strong> The deepest suffering asks the deepest question. And receives silence — the unknowable that Axiom III requires. Three days of silence before the ring turns again.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The risen Christ restores the ring: &quot;Why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?&quot;</strong> Transcendent (why) → Immanent (whom). Purpose meets Person. The question-ring, broken at the cross, turns again at the tomb.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The ICT constraint applies to inquiry: you cannot fully answer WHO and WHAT simultaneously.</strong> Continuity (of relationship) and symmetry (of factual knowledge) cannot both be maximally held. The IM answers WHAT; Scripture answers WHO. Together they turn the ring.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>God&#39;s first five questions (Gen 3-4) follow a modal sequence: relational WHERE → WHO → WHAT.</strong> He never asks WHY or WHEN of the fallen. The transcendent question — purpose — is withheld from those who have broken the ring. Purpose must be restored before it can be asked.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The six questions map through Good/True/Beautiful.</strong> Goodness answers Who/How (in self). Truth answers What/When (in world). Beauty answers Where/Why (in other). Each quality has an existence-face and a process-face.</p>
</li>
