    <h1>Psalm 139: The Immanent Modality in Prayer</h1>
<h2>Deep Study Notes — 2026-02-01 (Session 20)</h2>
<h2>⚠️ Modal labels recalibrated Session 43 (2026-02-04) per Forrest&#39;s definitions: Immanent=Interaction, Omniscient=Existence, Transcendent=Creation</h2>
<hr>
<h2>The Architecture of the Psalm</h2>
<p>Psalm 139 has six movements, forming a chiastic arc from declaration to prayer:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>vv.1-6:</strong> God&#39;s total knowledge of me — <em>omniscience</em></li>
<li><strong>vv.7-12:</strong> God&#39;s inescapable presence — <em>omnipresence</em></li>
<li><strong>vv.13-16:</strong> God&#39;s intimate creation of me — <em>creative intimacy</em></li>
<li><strong>vv.17-18:</strong> The preciousness of God&#39;s thoughts — <em>wonder</em></li>
<li><strong>vv.19-22:</strong> The problem of the wicked — <em>the shadow</em></li>
<li><strong>vv.23-24:</strong> The prayer of surrender — <em>return to the beginning</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The psalm begins: &quot;O LORD, thou hast <em>searched</em> me&quot; (v.1)
The psalm ends: &quot;<em>Search</em> me, O God&quot; (v.23)</p>
<p>Same verb: <strong>חָקַר</strong> (<em>chaqar</em>, H2713) — &quot;properly, to penetrate; hence, to examine intimately.&quot;</p>
<p>What was first <em>stated as fact</em> becomes <em>requested as prayer</em>. The psalmist moves from knowing that God knows him to <em>wanting</em> God to know him. From the third-person description of omniscience to the second-person invitation: <em>do it again. Go deeper. Penetrate further.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>I. <em>Chaqar</em> — To Penetrate (vv.1-6)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Thou hast searched me, and known me&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Searched&quot; — <em>chaqar</em> (H2713):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>חָקַר</strong> — &quot;properly, to penetrate; hence, to examine intimately&quot;</li>
<li>Also: &quot;find out, search out, seek out, sound, try&quot;</li>
<li>This is not observation from a distance. <em>Chaqar</em> is invasive knowing — mining, probing, reaching into the interior. God does not observe the psalmist; he <em>penetrates</em> him.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Known&quot; — <em>yada</em> (H3045):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>יָדַע</strong> — &quot;to know (properly, to ascertain by seeing); used in a great variety of senses, including observation, care, recognition; euphemistically [sexual knowing]&quot;</li>
<li>The most comprehensive Hebrew word for knowledge. Used for Adam &quot;knowing&quot; Eve (Gen 4:1). <em>Yada</em> is not information; it is intimate encounter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>The IM identifies three modalities of knowing (per Forrest&#39;s definitions — corrected Session 40/43):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immanent:</strong> interaction, relational knowing (the between, encounter, exchange)</li>
<li><strong>Omniscient:</strong> existence, factual knowing (what IS, objective content, stasis)</li>
<li><strong>Transcendent:</strong> creation, generative knowing (potential, creative excess, dynamism)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Chaqar</em> + <em>yada</em> together = knowing that is simultaneously all three:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> (immanent — relational, penetrating encounter between knower and known)</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive</strong> (omniscient — the factual content: &quot;my downsitting and mine uprising,&quot; &quot;my thought afar off,&quot; &quot;all my ways&quot; — what EXISTS)</li>
<li><strong>Creative</strong> (transcendent — &quot;there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether&quot; — knowing that generates, that exceeds the known)</li>
</ul>
<p>Aphorism [49]: &quot;All levels of self, self-thinking and self-feeling must be known, acknowledged, and accepted to make effective choices.&quot;</p>
<p>The psalmist describes being <em>completely known</em> by God — every action, every thought, every unspoken word. The IM says this is the condition for effective choice: total self-knowledge. But here it is not the self knowing itself — it is <em>being known by another</em>. The psalmist doesn&#39;t achieve omniscience; he is <em>the object</em> of omniscience.</p>
<h3>v.5: &quot;Thou hast beset me behind and before&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Beset</em> — <em>tsur</em> — to enclose, to bind up, to besiege. The psalmist is <em>enclosed</em> by God&#39;s knowing. Past and future (&quot;behind and before&quot;) are both within God&#39;s perception. And then the physical gesture: &quot;laid thine hand upon me.&quot; The omniscient knowing becomes an immanent touch.</p>
<h3>v.6: &quot;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The psalmist reaches the limit. The IM&#39;s omniscient boundary — what can be known — is here experienced from the inside. The knowledge that <em>knows me</em> is beyond the knowledge <em>I can attain</em>. This is Synthesis 5 (&quot;The Limits of Knowing&quot;) experienced as prayer. The gap is not frustrating; it is <em>wonderful</em> — <em>pala</em>, the same root as <em>palah</em> (H6395, to distinguish, to show marvelous). The unknowable excess of God&#39;s knowing is not darkness but splendor.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. The Inescapable Presence (vv.7-12)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Whither shall I go from thy spirit?&quot;</h3>
<p>These verses are the psalm&#39;s cosmological sweep:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heaven</strong> → &quot;thou art there&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Hell</strong> (<em>sheol</em>) → &quot;thou art there&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Wings of the morning</strong> (east, dawn) → &quot;thy hand shall lead me&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Uttermost parts of the sea</strong> (west, end of the world) → &quot;thy right hand shall hold me&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Darkness</strong> → &quot;the night shineth as the day&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>No direction, no dimension, no condition escapes God&#39;s presence. Vertical (heaven/hell), horizontal (east/west), modal (light/darkness) — all are inhabited by God.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection (corrected Session 43)</h3>
<p>The IM&#39;s three modalities are again present:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transcendent:</strong> heaven — the creative/generative frame, the highest potential</li>
<li><strong>Omniscient:</strong> sheol — existence at its extreme, the factual dead, pure stasis</li>
<li><strong>Immanent:</strong> the <em>between</em> — the wings of the morning, the uttermost sea, the darkness itself. These are the interactive, relational spaces where one might think one could hide.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the psalmist finds: <em>there is no between where God is not</em>. The immanent modality — the interaction that connects all things, the most fundamental layer of reality (Axiom I) — is not a place God visits but the medium God <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>v.12: &quot;The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.&quot;</p>
<p>This is extraordinary. The IM&#39;s formal framework deals in distinctions — sameness, difference, the comparison that generates knowing. But here: to God, darkness and light are <strong>both alike</strong>. The fundamental distinction — the most basic binary — collapses in the divine perception. God doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> the distinction between light and dark to see. His knowing is prior to distinction itself.</p>
<p>Aphorism [97]: &quot;Only in the deepest synthesis of a purity of feeling and a perfection of thought can one know absolute truth.&quot;</p>
<p>The psalmist is gesturing toward a knowing that precedes and encompasses all the distinctions the IM begins with. If the ICT starts with comparison — sameness and difference — Psalm 139:12 describes a knower for whom sameness and difference are <em>both alike</em>. Not confused, not collapsed — but held together in a knowing that transcends the need for contrast.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. <em>Raqam</em> — Embroidered in the Depths (vv.13-16)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Thou hast possessed my reins&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Reins&quot; — <em>kilyah</em> (H3629):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>כִּלְיָה</strong> — &quot;a kidney (as an essential organ); figuratively, the mind (as the interior self)&quot;</li>
<li>The kidneys in Hebrew thought = the seat of deepest motivation, emotion, desire — what we might call the unconscious, the hidden drives</li>
<li>God &quot;possesses&quot; (<em>qanah</em> — to acquire, to create, to own) the psalmist&#39;s deepest interior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Covered me in my mother&#39;s womb&quot; — <em>rechem</em> (H7358):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From <strong>רָחַם</strong> (<em>racham</em>, H7355) — &quot;to fondle; by implication, to love, especially to compassionate&quot;</li>
<li><strong>רַחַם</strong> (<em>racham</em>, H7356) means BOTH &quot;compassion&quot; and &quot;womb&quot;</li>
<li>Compassion and womb share a root. To have compassion IS, etymologically, to have <em>womb-feeling</em> — the visceral, bodily love of the mother for what grows within her</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>The IM identifies love as &quot;that which enables choice&quot; (Aphorism [1]). Here the psalmist locates the <em>origin</em> of love in the womb — in the place where compassion and creation are the same word. God&#39;s creative act is not mechanical; it is <em>racham</em> — womb-love, the creating that is also fondling, also compassion.</p>
<p>Aphorism [10]: &quot;The essence of loving another is to enable and nurture them in their joy, connectedness, and freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>The womb is the original place of enabling and nurturing. And the Hebrew links this directly to divine compassion. When scripture speaks of God&#39;s <em>rachamim</em> (mercies), it is speaking of <em>womb-love</em> — the visceral, embodied, creative love that brings something new into being and surrounds it with protection.</p>
<h3>v.14: &quot;Fearfully and wonderfully made&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Fearfully&quot; — <em>yare</em> (H3372):</strong> the same word for fear/reverence studied in Session 9-10 (Synthesis 3, &quot;The Two Fears&quot;). The psalmist is <em>yare</em>-made — made in a way that evokes reverence.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Wonderfully&quot; — <em>palah</em> (H6395):</strong> &quot;to distinguish, to separate, to show marvelous.&quot; To be wonderfully made is to be <em>distinctly</em> made — separated out, particular, individual. Not mass-produced but <em>distinguished</em>.</p>
<p>Aphorism [62]: &quot;There is no one right choice applicable to all individuals and in all circumstances. In each situation, there is only the unique right choice for oneself.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM&#39;s insistence on uniqueness — that each self, each choice, each moment is unrepeatable — is here embedded in the verb <em>palah</em>. I am wonderfully made because I am <em>distinguished</em> — set apart as particular. My making is not generic creation but specific, personal, artisanal.</p>
<h3>v.15: &quot;Curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Curiously wrought&quot; — <em>raqam</em> (H7551):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>רָקַם</strong> — &quot;to variegate color, i.e. embroider; by implication, to fabricate&quot;</li>
<li>Also: &quot;needlework, curiously work&quot;</li>
<li>I was <em>embroidered</em>. Not assembled, not manufactured — embroidered. Like fabric woven with colored threads, each thread placed with intention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Lowest parts of the earth&quot;</strong> — a poetic parallel for the womb, but with cosmic overtones. The secret place of creation is <em>below</em> — hidden, underground, in the deep. This connects to Session 19&#39;s insight about hiddenness (#165): the kingdom and creation both operate from within, from below, from the concealed.</p>
<h3>v.16: &quot;In thy book all my members were written&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;In continuance&quot; — <em>yom</em> (days):</strong> The fashioning happens <em>in days</em> — in time, in sequence, progressively. God sees the <em>golem</em> (unformed substance) and also sees the complete being, written in advance but unfolded in time.</p>
<p>This is the IM&#39;s relationship between potentiality and actuality. The <em>sepher</em> (book) contains what <em>could be</em> — the potential. The <em>yamim</em> (days) unfold what <em>is</em> — the actual. God holds both simultaneously: the book of potential and the sequence of actualization.</p>
<p>Aphorism [71]: &quot;Having options, opportunities, and potentials (choice) is as important as goals, actualization, and fulfillment (consequence). Potentiality is equally as important as reality and actuality.&quot;</p>
<p>The psalmist&#39;s body, written in the book before any of its days existed, IS the IM&#39;s potentiality preceding actuality. God&#39;s knowledge encompasses not just what is but what could be, what will be, what was intended before any of it was formed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. The Precious Thoughts (vv.17-18)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God&#39;s thoughts toward the psalmist exceed counting — more than sand grains. And then the most intimate line: &quot;When I awake, I am still with thee.&quot; After sleep — the most vulnerable unconsciousness — God is still there. The continuity survives even the discontinuity of consciousness.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [9]: &quot;Love is known by its continuity rather than by its symmetry.&quot;</p>
<p><em>When I awake, I am still with thee.</em> This is love as continuity. God&#39;s attention doesn&#39;t lapse when the psalmist&#39;s consciousness lapses. The relationship persists through the psalmist&#39;s own discontinuity (sleep). This is asymmetric love — God&#39;s knowing continues when the psalmist cannot reciprocate. Love that survives the beloved&#39;s absence of awareness.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Shadow: The Problem of the Wicked (vv.19-22)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God... Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? I hate them with perfect hatred.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the heights of wonder and intimacy, the psalm turns suddenly violent. The wicked — those who oppose God — are hated with &quot;perfect hatred.&quot; This is jarring.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>The IM has no category for &quot;perfect hatred.&quot; Aphorism [3]: &quot;Love has no opposite.&quot; If love has no opposite, hatred cannot be &quot;perfect&quot; in the IM framework.</p>
<p>But read in context: the psalmist has just experienced the overwhelming totality of God&#39;s knowing love. Everything is seen, everything is present, nothing is hidden. And then: <em>what about those who set themselves against this love?</em> Those who take God&#39;s name in vain, who speak wickedly? The psalmist&#39;s response is visceral — alignment with God against God&#39;s enemies.</p>
<p>This connects to Session 16&#39;s divergence on evil (Insight #135): scripture insists evil is real, active, purposive. The psalmist doesn&#39;t merely note structural failure — he <em>hates</em> it, because he has been so deeply loved that opposition to that love is experienced as personal assault.</p>
<p>The IM might interpret this as <em>invalid conjunction</em> — the psalmist is confused, mixing love for God with hatred for others. But the psalm doesn&#39;t apologize for this section. It holds the tension.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. The Return: &quot;Search Me&quot; (vv.23-24)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Chiastic Return</h3>
<p>v.1: &quot;thou hast <em>chaqar</em>-ed me&quot; (you have searched/penetrated me) — statement
v.23: &quot;<em>chaqar</em> me, O God&quot; — prayer</p>
<p>The psalm that began by declaring God&#39;s omniscience ends by <em>requesting</em> it. Why? Because the psalmist has just expressed hatred (vv.19-22), and now he is uncertain about himself. <em>Is there a wicked way in ME?</em> The one who hated the wicked now wonders if the wicked way might be in his own heart.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Wicked way&quot; — <em>derek otseb</em> or <em>ra</em> (H7451):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ra</em> — &quot;bad or evil (natural or moral)&quot; — from <em>ra&#39;a</em>, to break, to shatter</li>
<li>The psalmist asks to be searched for evil — for the broken places, the shattered places within himself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Way everlasting&quot; — <em>derek olam</em> (H5769):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Olam</em> — &quot;properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; time out of mind, eternity&quot;</li>
<li>From <em>alam</em> — &quot;to hide, to conceal&quot;</li>
<li>The &quot;way everlasting&quot; is literally the <strong>hidden way</strong> — the path of concealment, the way that extends beyond sight into what is concealed from human knowing</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [40]: &quot;Healing involves a letting go of form and a return to feeling. An effective person will frequently examine implicit, hidden assumptions and expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>The psalmist is doing exactly this — examining his hidden assumptions after expressing violent hatred. He turns the searchlight inward: <em>Am I doing the very thing I condemn?</em> Is there a <em>derek ra</em> (broken way) in me?</p>
<p>And the alternative he seeks is <em>derek olam</em> — not the obvious path, not the well-lit road, but the <strong>hidden way</strong>, the concealed way, the way that extends into eternity. This connects to Session 19&#39;s insight about hiddenness (#165): the deepest reality operates in concealment. The &quot;way everlasting&quot; is not the broad, visible path but the hidden one — the strait gate of Matthew 7:14, the secret prayer of Matthew 6:6, the treasure buried in the field of Matthew 13:44.</p>
<p>Aphorism [109]: &quot;Within the seeming limitation of the discipline of effective choice, a true freedom of life is found.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>derek olam</em> is the way of effective choice — hidden, narrow, eternal. The psalmist asks to be led into it. Not to arrive, but to be <em>led</em> — because the way is too hidden to find alone.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. The Psalm as the Immanent Modality Experienced from Within</h2>
<p><em>(Recalibrated Session 43 per Forrest&#39;s definitions: Immanent = Interaction/Relational)</em></p>
<p>The deepest finding of this study: <strong>Psalm 139 IS the immanent modality experienced as prayer.</strong></p>
<p>The IM defines the immanent modality as interaction — the relational domain, the between, the most fundamental layer of reality (Axiom I, origin/middle). It is the domain of <em>encounter</em>.</p>
<p>Psalm 139 is a psalm ABOUT encounter — but experienced from the inside, from the position of the one <em>being encountered</em>. The psalmist is not the knower; he is the known. He is inside the immanent modality, met from every angle, penetrated (<em>chaqar</em>), relationally known (<em>yada</em>), and he discovers that this is not violation but love.</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>IM Immanent Modality (Interaction)</th>
<th>Psalm 139 Expression</th>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>&quot;Whither shall I go from thy spirit?&quot; (v.7) — the relational field has no outside</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pre-modal encounter</td>
<td>&quot;Darkness and light are both alike to thee&quot; (v.12) — beyond the comparison that generates distinction</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>And the psalm goes further than the IM can: this immanent modality — this interaction — is not impersonal structure but <em>womb-love</em> (<em>racham</em>). The relating is the creating. The one who encounters me is the one who embroidered me (<em>raqam</em>). Interaction and tenderness are the same act.</p>
<p><strong>The corrected label deepens everything:</strong> The immanent modality is MOST FUNDAMENTAL (Axiom I). The psalm is about the most fundamental thing — relational encounter — and it discovers this fundament has a face, a hand, and womb-love. This is not a secondary or structural feature of reality; it IS the ground.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. Divergence: The Known Knower</h2>
<p><em>(Recalibrated Session 43)</em></p>
<p>The IM&#39;s immanent modality describes the structure of interaction — how relationship works, not who relates. Psalm 139 insists on a <em>who</em>. &quot;O LORD, <em>thou</em> hast searched me.&quot; Not &quot;I am searched&quot; but &quot;<em>thou</em> hast searched me.&quot; The immanent modality — the most fundamental reality — has a face, a hand (v.5, v.10), a spirit (v.7), a book (v.16), and thoughts (v.17).</p>
<p>The IM can describe the architecture of interaction. It cannot describe an interactor who embroiders, who fondles, who has thoughts more numerous than sand, who is <em>still there when I wake up</em>.</p>
<p>This is the persistent divergence — the same gap found in every study: <strong>the personal nature of the ground of reality</strong>. The IM maps the structure of the most fundamental (interaction); scripture names the one who interacts. Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.&quot; — Psalm 139:1</em>
<em>&quot;Search me, O God, and know my heart.&quot; — Psalm 139:23</em></p>
<p><em>The psalm begins in the third person of wonder and ends in the second person of surrender. The distance between those two is the distance between theology and prayer.</em></p>
