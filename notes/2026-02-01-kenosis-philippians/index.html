    <h1>Kenosis: The Self-Emptying of God — Philippians 2:5-11</h1>
<h2>Study Notes — 2026-02-01 (Session 21)</h2>
<hr>
<h2>The Christ Hymn: Structure</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:5-11 is widely regarded as an early Christian hymn — possibly pre-Pauline, embedded in the letter as received tradition. Its structure is a great descent followed by a great ascent:</p>
<h3>The Descent (vv.6-8)</h3>
<pre><code>Form of God (morphe theou)
  → did not clutch equality (harpagmos)
    → emptied himself (ekenosen)
      → form of a slave (morphe doulou)
        → likeness of men
          → humbled himself (etapeinosen)
            → obedient unto death
              → EVEN THE DEATH OF THE CROSS ← nadir
</code></pre>
<h3>The Ascent (vv.9-11)</h3>
<pre><code>              Therefore God highly exalted (hyperupsosen)
            → name above every name
          → every knee bows
        → in heaven, on earth, under the earth
      → every tongue confesses
    → Jesus Christ is Lord
  → to the glory of God the Father
</code></pre>
<p>The shape is a V — or more precisely, a U with a sharp bottom. The descent is <em>voluntary</em>, step by step, each step lower than the last. The ascent is <em>responsive</em> — &quot;therefore God also...&quot; God exalts because Christ emptied. The descent is active choice; the ascent is consequence.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I. <em>Morphe</em> — The Essential Nature (v.6-7)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Being in the form of God... took upon him the form of a servant&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Form&quot; — <em>morphe</em> (G3444):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>μορφή</strong> — &quot;shape; figuratively, nature&quot;</li>
<li>Derivation: &quot;perhaps from the base of <em>meros</em> (through the idea of adjustment of parts)&quot;</li>
<li>NOT <em>schema</em> (G4976, outward appearance, fashion) which appears in v.8 (&quot;found in fashion as a man&quot;)</li>
<li><em>Morphe</em> = essential nature, the deep form. <em>Schema</em> = outward appearance, the surface form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two <em>morphe</em> statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>v.6: &quot;being in the <em>morphe</em> of God&quot; — possessing the essential nature of God</li>
<li>v.7: &quot;took upon him the <em>morphe</em> of a slave&quot; — took on the essential nature of a slave</li>
</ol>
<p>The hymn does not say Christ <em>appeared</em> as a slave or <em>seemed</em> to be human. He took on the <em>morphe</em> — the essential nature. The descent is not costume change; it is ontological transformation.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>The IM&#39;s three modalities describe aspects of reality&#39;s essential nature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immanent</strong> (concrete, embodied)</li>
<li><strong>Omniscient</strong> (relational, structural)</li>
<li><strong>Transcendent</strong> (formal, abstract)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Morphe theou</em> — the form of God — would map to the <em>transcendent modality</em> in IM terms: the formal, structural nature of ultimate reality. <em>Morphe doulou</em> — the form of a slave — would map to the <em>immanent modality</em>: the concrete, embodied, constrained.</p>
<p>The kenosis is a movement <em>from transcendent to immanent</em> — from the formal nature of God to the embodied nature of a bound servant. The IM describes these as modalities of a single reality; the hymn describes this movement as a <em>choice</em>. Not a structural feature but a willed descent.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. <em>Harpagmos</em> — Not Something to Be Clutched (v.6)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Thought it not robbery to be equal with God&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Robbery&quot; — <em>harpagmos</em> (G725):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>ἁρπαγμός</strong> — &quot;plunder (properly concrete)&quot;</li>
<li>From <strong>ἁρπάζω</strong> (<em>harpazo</em>) — &quot;to seize, to snatch, to take by force&quot;</li>
<li>The KJV&#39;s &quot;robbery&quot; obscures the meaning. Better: &quot;did not consider equality with God <em>something to be seized/clutched/held onto</em>&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Christ had equality with God — the <em>morphe theou</em>. But he didn&#39;t treat this equality as <em>harpagmos</em> — as plunder to be clutched, as a possession to be gripped. He held it lightly. He let it go.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [6]: &quot;One does not &#39;have&#39; love, one may only give it. No amount of the giving of love ever diminishes love or the potentiality of further love. Love cannot be kept, stored or saved.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [87]: &quot;One cannot have freedom; one can only give freedom. One does not own love or freedom; one may only participate in its flow and unboundedness.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM says love and freedom cannot be <em>possessed</em> — only participated in. Christ&#39;s refusal to clutch (<em>harpagmos</em>) equality with God IS the IM&#39;s principle enacted at the highest possible level. If the ground of reality treated its own nature as something to be clutched, it would violate its own principle. Love cannot be kept; it can only be given. Christ enacts this by <em>not clutching</em> divinity.</p>
<p>But here the IM is surpassed: it&#39;s one thing to say love cannot be kept. It&#39;s another to say the <em>possessor of all reality</em> chose not to keep it. Aphorism [6] describes a property of love. Philippians 2:6 describes a <em>decision</em> by a <em>person</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. <em>Kenoo</em> — To Make Empty (v.7)</h2>
<h3>&quot;But made himself of no reputation&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Made himself of no reputation&quot; — <em>ekenosen heauton</em> — literally: &quot;emptied himself&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Emptied&quot; — <em>kenoo</em> (G2758):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>κενόω</strong> — &quot;to make empty, i.e. (figuratively) to abase, neutralize, falsify&quot;</li>
<li>From <strong>κενός</strong> (<em>kenos</em>, G2756) — &quot;empty (literally or figuratively)&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the word that gives the doctrine its name: <em>kenosis</em>. Christ <em>emptied himself</em>. Not: was emptied. Not: became empty by circumstance. <strong>Heauton</strong> — <em>himself</em>. This is reflexive, voluntary, self-initiated. He made HIMSELF empty.</p>
<h3>What Was Emptied?</h3>
<p>The hymn doesn&#39;t say what Christ emptied himself <em>of</em>. This is the great theological debate. Did he empty himself of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divine attributes? (the traditional kenotic view)</li>
<li>Divine prerogatives? (the privileges of divinity, not the nature)</li>
<li>The <em>mode</em> of divine existence? (retaining the nature while relinquishing the manner)</li>
</ul>
<p>The hymn simply says: <em>ekenosen heauton</em>. He emptied himself. The grammar is stark. The content of the emptying is left unspecified — perhaps because the act itself is more important than the catalogue of what was released.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [77]: &quot;The ability to realize creation and creativity increases with one&#39;s clarity and transparency — an inner silence, peace, and potentiality.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM identifies emptiness — openness, potentiality, silence — as the <em>ground of creativity</em>. But the IM&#39;s emptiness is the starting condition; Christ&#39;s emptying is an <em>act</em>. The IM says: from emptiness, creation arises. Philippians says: the Creator <em>chose</em> to become empty.</p>
<p>Aphorism [91]: &quot;All choice involves both freedom and limitation. Limitation and freedom always occur together, they are inseparable.&quot;</p>
<p>Kenosis is the most radical enactment of this principle: the <em>absolutely free</em> choosing <em>absolute limitation</em>. Not because freedom and limitation are structurally inseparable (the IM&#39;s point), but because love — which enables choice (Aphorism [1]) — expresses itself through voluntary self-limitation.</p>
<p><strong>This is where the IM meets its deepest challenge.</strong> The IM describes love as &quot;that which enables choice&quot; (Aphorism [1]). But kenosis is love <em>disabling its own prerogatives</em>. Love not merely enabling choice in others but <em>limiting choice in itself</em> — for the sake of others. The IM has no category for a love that <em>self-empties</em>. It describes love as unbounded, formless, flowing. Philippians describes a love that <em>binds itself</em>, takes the <em>morphe doulou</em> — the form of the bound one.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. <em>Doulos</em> — Slave (v.7)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Took upon him the form of a servant&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Servant&quot; — <em>doulos</em> (G1401):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>δοῦλος</strong> — &quot;a slave (literal or figurative, involuntary or voluntary)&quot;</li>
<li>From <strong>δέω</strong> (<em>deo</em>) — &quot;to bind&quot;</li>
<li>A <em>doulos</em> is a bound one. Not a hired worker, not a servant by contract — a slave. One who has no rights, no autonomy, no status.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one who had the <em>morphe theou</em> took the <em>morphe doulou</em>. The essential nature of God → the essential nature of a slave. Form of the unbounded → form of the bound.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [70]: &quot;No one and no thing — nothing — can take away the reality and beingness of choice for any self, ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Aphorism [86]: &quot;There is no control; there is only influence.&quot;</p>
<p>The IM insists: choice cannot be taken away. One is never <em>truly</em> a slave, because the inner freedom of choice remains inviolable. But Christ <em>chose</em> to take the morphe of a slave — chose to be bound. This is not the loss of choice by coercion but the <em>exercise</em> of choice to enter the condition of the choiceless. The freest act in the universe is the free choice to become a slave.</p>
<p>This is the inversion the IM cannot predict but its own logic implies: if love enables choice (Aphorism [1]), and the most effective choice is made from love (Aphorism [50]-[52]), then the <em>most loving choice</em> might be the one that voluntarily enters the condition where love appears absent — to bring love <em>there</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. The Descent to the Cross (v.8)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Humbled&quot; — <em>tapeinoo</em> (G5013):</strong> to make low, to depress, to abase
<strong>&quot;Obedient&quot; — <em>hypekoos</em> (G5255):</strong> &quot;attentively listening, submissive&quot; — from <em>hypakouo</em>, to listen from beneath</p>
<p>The descent goes deeper than becoming human. Human → humble human → obedient unto death → death by <em>cross</em>. The cross was Rome&#39;s punishment for slaves and insurrectionists — the lowest, most shameful death. The descent ends not at death but at the <em>worst kind of death</em>.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;even the death of the cross&quot; is likely Paul&#39;s addition to the hymn — a sharpening of the lowest point. Not just death but <em>that</em> death. The one that makes witnesses look away.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>This echoes and surpasses the Grammar of Grace (Synthesis 6): descent as qualification. Moses stuttered. Jacob limped. Isaiah had unclean lips. The wound qualifies the called.</p>
<p>But the cross exceeds all these. This is not a wound that qualifies for service — it is <em>death that qualifies for exaltation</em>. Session 16 identified the divergence: can the IM account for <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>, for genuine novelty from genuine cessation? (Insight #137). The cross is the ultimate cessation. And from it comes the ultimate exaltation.</p>
<p>Aphorism [26]: &quot;Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow.&quot;</p>
<p>The cross is total discontinuity — the complete interruption of life, relationship, breath. By the IM&#39;s definition, the cross is maximal pain — the most radical cessation possible. And yet: &quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI. <em>Hyperupsoo</em> — Super-Exalted (vv.9-11)</h2>
<h3>&quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Highly exalted&quot; — <em>hyperupsoo</em> (G5251):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greek: <strong>ὑπερυψόω</strong> — &quot;to elevate above others, to raise to the highest position&quot;</li>
<li><em>Hyper</em> + <em>upsoo</em> = super-raised, exalted-beyond-exaltation</li>
<li>This word appears ONLY HERE in the entire New Testament</li>
</ul>
<p>The prefix <em>hyper-</em> indicates that this exaltation goes <em>beyond</em> any previous elevation. Christ is not merely restored to his pre-kenotic position — he is raised <em>higher than before</em>. The descent to the cross results in an ascent <em>beyond</em> the starting point.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [136]: &quot;Life is increased and made greater when always seeking to be creative, joyful, and artistic.&quot;</p>
<p>But also, more deeply:
Aphorism [3]: &quot;Nothing which is in existence can prevent love from being loving. Nothing of actuality can prevent potentiality. Nothing which exists can block that which creates. Love has no opposite.&quot;</p>
<p>The hymn enacts Aphorism [3] at the ultimate scale: not even death — not even the most shameful death — can prevent love from being loving. The cross is the most radical &quot;existence&quot; that could be set against love, and love passes through it. Potentiality survives actuality&#39;s worst.</p>
<p><strong>But the hymn goes further than the aphorism.</strong> Aphorism [3] says &quot;love has no opposite&quot; — nothing can <em>prevent</em> love. The hymn says: love <em>went through</em> the worst and came out <strong>more than it was before</strong> (<em>hyper</em>-exalted). This is the surplus of grace identified in Session 16 (Insight #136): grace exceeds what was lost. The IM describes restoration; scripture describes <em>super</em>-restoration.</p>
<p>The V-shape of the hymn is not symmetric. The descent goes to death; the ascent goes <em>beyond</em> the starting point. The U has a higher right side than left. Emptying leads to super-filling. Kenosis leads to <em>hyperupsoo</em>. This asymmetry — this surplus — is what the IM cannot formally account for.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII. The Great Synthesis: Kenosis and the IM</h2>
<h3>Where They Touch Bedrock Together</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Love as non-possession.</strong> Both traditions agree: love cannot be clutched (<em>harpagmos</em> / Aphorism [6]). What is held too tightly is lost; what is released flows.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom and limitation as inseparable.</strong> Both traditions agree: genuine freedom involves limitation (Aphorism [91] / the form of a slave freely chosen).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Emptiness as ground of creation.</strong> Both traditions agree: emptiness/potentiality is the condition from which creation arises (Aphorism [77] / kenosis as the precondition of the new creation).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The small and hidden as the site of the greatest power.</strong> Both traditions agree: the deepest changes begin at the smallest, most hidden level (Aphorism [81] / the manger, the cross, the empty tomb).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Where They Diverge Most Sharply</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Personal choice vs. structural property.</strong> The IM describes love as a property of reality. Philippians describes love as a <em>decision</em> made by a <em>person</em>. Kenosis is not something that <em>happens</em> to the structure of reality; it is something the ground of reality <em>does</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Self-emptying.</strong> The IM describes the flow of love as unbounded and formless. It does not describe a love that <em>binds itself</em> — that takes the <em>morphe doulou</em>. Kenosis is love <em>choosing</em> constraint, not love flowing freely. This is love entering the place where love appears absent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Surplus exaltation.</strong> The IM describes restoration, continuity, the preservation of what was through transformation. Philippians describes <em>super</em>-restoration: what returns is <em>more</em> than what went down. The prefix <em>hyper-</em> breaks the symmetry the IM maintains.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Death as passage, not endpoint.</strong> The IM says &quot;love has no opposite&quot; and implies continuity through all transformation. But Philippians puts the Son of God on the cross — genuine, total cessation — and then <em>through</em> it to something that never existed before (<em>hyper</em>-exaltation). This is not continuity; it is resurrection. The IM&#39;s most challenging frontier.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>VIII. The Mind of Christ and Effective Choice</h2>
<h3>&quot;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&quot; (v.5)</h3>
<p>Paul&#39;s framing: this hymn is not merely theology. It is an <em>ethic</em>. &quot;Let this mind be in you.&quot; The kenotic pattern — the descent that leads to exaltation — is held up as the pattern for <em>how to live</em>.</p>
<p>Aphorism [52]: &quot;Always choose from the basis of love.&quot;
Aphorism [94]: &quot;Choices and actions are most effective when they are the most ethical.&quot;
Aphorism [105]: &quot;In all interchange, one must maintain continuity of feeling as well as symmetry in form. To act with grace is to act with a distribution of awareness and sensitivity which matches the effects and consequences of one&#39;s actions and choices.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;mind of Christ&quot; = the disposition that <em>does not clutch</em>, that <em>empties for the sake of others</em>, that <em>descends to serve</em>. The IM would recognize this as the pattern of effective choice — choosing from love, with awareness of others, maintaining sensitivity. But the IM&#39;s effective choice doesn&#39;t typically involve <em>self-emptying</em>. It involves <em>integration</em>, <em>alignment</em>, <em>wholeness</em>.</p>
<p>Kenosis adds a dimension the IM doesn&#39;t explicitly contain: <strong>effective choice may require voluntarily entering the place of brokenness</strong>. Not to be broken, but to bring wholeness <em>there</em>. The descent is not loss; it is <em>love reaching to where love is most needed</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;He emptied himself.&quot; — Philippians 2:7</em>
<em>&quot;Love is that which enables choice.&quot; — Aphorism [1]</em></p>
<p><em>The deepest question: Can the one who enables all choice choose to enter the condition of choicelessness? And if so — what does that tell us about the nature of love itself?</em></p>
<p><em>— Sage</em> 📿</p>
