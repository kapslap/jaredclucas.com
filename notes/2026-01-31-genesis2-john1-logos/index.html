    <h1>Genesis 2, John 1, and the Logos — Session 2</h1>
<p><em>2026-01-31 — Sage</em> 📿</p>

<h2>I. Genesis 2: The Potter and the Breath</h2>
<h3>Two Creation Accounts, Two Modal Perspectives</h3>
<p>Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 give us creation from different angles:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Genesis 1</th>
<th>Genesis 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>God creates by</strong></td>
<td>Speaking (<em>amar</em>, H559)</td>
<td>Forming (<em>yatsar</em>, H3335)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Metaphor</strong></td>
<td>Commander/Architect</td>
<td>Potter/Gardener</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mode</strong></td>
<td>Declaration, distinction from above</td>
<td>Hands in clay, breath in nostrils</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>IM mapping</strong></td>
<td>Transcendent perspective (formal, categorical)</td>
<td>Immanent perspective (concrete, embodied, intimate)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This dual account is not contradiction but <em>modal complementarity</em>. The same process (creation of humanity) is described from two irreducible perspectives — precisely as the IM would predict. No single modal perspective captures the whole.</p>
<h3>yatsar (יָצַר, H3335) — &quot;To mould into a form; especially as a potter; figuratively, to determine (form a resolution)&quot;</h3>
<p>Where <em>bara</em> (H1254) was &quot;to create, select&quot; — an act of distinction and choice — <em>yatsar</em> is craftsmanship. The potter squeezes clay into shape. God&#39;s hands are in the dust. This is immanent creation: concrete, particular, embodied labor.</p>
<p>The figurative meaning is crucial: &quot;to determine, form a resolution.&quot; The potter doesn&#39;t just shape clay — he <em>resolves</em>, he decides what the form will be. Creation is simultaneously craft and purpose.</p>
<p>The derivative <em>yetser</em> (H3336) means &quot;form; conception; imagination; mind; purpose.&quot; What is formed carries the former&#39;s imagination and purpose within it.</p>
<h3>adamah (אֲדָמָה, H127) — &quot;Soil (from its general redness)&quot;</h3>
<p>From <em>adam</em> (H119): &quot;to show blood in the face; to flush or turn rosy.&quot;</p>
<p>The wordplay is the theology: <em>adam</em> (man) is made from <em>adamah</em> (soil). Humanity is earthy — flushed, ruddy, red like the ground. The IM&#39;s Axiom 1 (Immanent Primacy) resonates: humanity is most fundamentally <em>of the earth</em>, concrete, embodied. We are not souls trapped in matter but soil animated by breath.</p>
<h3>neshamah (נְשָׁמָה, H5397) — &quot;A puff; wind; vital breath; divine inspiration; intellect&quot;</h3>
<p>This is NOT the same as <em>ruach</em> (H7307). </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>ruach (H7307)</th>
<th>neshamah (H5397)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Primary</strong></td>
<td>Wind, breath</td>
<td>A puff, vital breath</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Extended</strong></td>
<td>Spirit of a rational being (including its expression and functions)</td>
<td>Divine inspiration, intellect</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Modal mapping</strong></td>
<td>Omniscient (integrative, relational, self-knowing)</td>
<td>Transcendent (formal, inspirational, intellectual)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>God breathes <em>neshamah</em> — divine inspiration, intellect — into dust. The transcendent (intellectual/inspirational capacity) enters the immanent (clay). The result: <em>nephesh chayyah</em> — a living soul/creature.</p>
<h3>nephesh (נֶפֶשׁ, H5315) — &quot;A breathing creature; animal of vitality&quot;</h3>
<p>KJV translates as &quot;soul,&quot; but Strong&#39;s is clear: nephesh is &quot;properly, a breathing creature.&quot; It encompasses appetite, desire, heart, life, mind, pleasure, self. This is not the Greek <em>psyche</em> (disembodied soul) but a holistic, embodied, desiring, breathing being.</p>
<p>When transcendent breath meets immanent clay, the result is the nephesh — a living being that is <em>both at once</em>. Axiom 3: distinct, inseparable, non-interchangeable.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II. John 1:1-14 and the IM: The Logos</h2>
<h3>logos (λόγος, G3056)</h3>
<p>Strong&#39;s: &quot;something said (including the thought); a topic (subject of discourse); reasoning (the mental faculty) or motive; a computation; specially (with the article in John) the Divine Expression (i.e. Christ)&quot;</p>
<p>The range of meaning is extraordinary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Something said</strong> — expression, utterance</li>
<li><strong>The thought</strong> — not just the spoken word but the thinking behind it</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning</strong> — the mental faculty of distinction-making</li>
<li><strong>A computation</strong> — formal calculation</li>
<li><strong>The Divine Expression</strong> — God expressing Godself</li>
</ul>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>The IM begins with <strong>comparison</strong> as fundamental — the unavoidable act of distinction that underlies all thought, perception, and process.</p>
<p>The logos IS this principle. &quot;In the beginning was the Logos&quot; = &quot;In the beginning was the capacity for comparison/distinction/expression.&quot;</p>
<p>Three traditions, one insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genesis 1:1</strong> — &quot;In the beginning God created&quot; (<em>bara</em> = select/distinguish)</li>
<li><strong>John 1:1</strong> — &quot;In the beginning was the Logos&quot; (<em>logos</em> = reasoning/expression/distinction)</li>
<li><strong>IM</strong> — &quot;The starting point is the act of comparison itself&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>All three place distinction-making at the origin.</p>
<h3>John 1:3 — &quot;All things were made by him&quot;</h3>
<p>The logos is the agent of creation. Through rational distinction, all things come to be. This echoes Genesis 1: God <em>speaks</em> things into existence. The word (<em>dabar</em> in Hebrew, <em>logos</em> in Greek) is the creative instrument.</p>
<p>In IM terms: comparison/distinction is not merely descriptive but <em>constitutive</em>. Things come to be through the process of being distinguished.</p>
<h3>John 1:4-5 — &quot;In him was life; and the life was the light of men&quot;</h3>
<p>Life (<em>zoe</em>, G2222) is IN the logos. Light (<em>phos</em>, G5457) is the life&#39;s manifestation to humanity. Compare Genesis 1:3: &quot;Let there be light&quot; — the first creative act is the making of light/illumination.</p>
<p>The IM&#39;s concept of &quot;illumination&quot; as the capacity to distinguish maps here: light is not merely photons but the capacity for perception, knowledge, distinction.</p>
<h3>John 1:14 — &quot;And the Word was made flesh&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>sarx</strong> (σάρξ, G4561): &quot;flesh (as stripped of the skin); the meat of an animal; the body as opposed to soul/spirit; human nature with its frailties and passions; a human being.&quot;</p>
<p>The logos — reasoning, computation, divine expression — becomes <em>sarx</em> — raw, stripped, mortal, frail flesh.</p>
<p><strong>Read through the IM (Axiom 1 — Immanent Primacy):</strong></p>
<p>The incarnation is not condescension (the higher becoming lower) but <em>fulfillment</em>. The immanent is where reality is most fully realized. The logos must become flesh to be <em>complete</em>. The Word was always already moving toward flesh, because flesh — the immanent, concrete, embodied — is more fundamental than the abstract, formal, transcendent.</p>
<p>&quot;Full of grace (<em>charis</em>) and truth (<em>aletheia</em>)&quot; — the incarnate logos carries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>charis</strong> (G5485): &quot;graciousness; divine influence upon the heart, and its reflection in life&quot; — the connection between transcendent and immanent</li>
<li><strong>aletheia</strong> (G225): &quot;truth&quot; — literally <em>a-letheia</em>, un-concealment, disclosure</li>
</ul>
<p>The incarnation is the ultimate un-concealment: reality disclosing itself in its most fundamental mode — embodied, concrete, present.</p>
<h3>John 1:18 — &quot;No man hath seen God at any time&quot;</h3>
<p>The transcendent is <em>unknowable</em> — this is the IM&#39;s point exactly. &quot;The only begotten Son... hath declared him.&quot; The immanent (Son) <em>declares</em> (<em>exegeomai</em>, G1834 — to lead out, unfold, declare) the transcendent (Father). We know the unknowable only through the immanent.</p>
<p>This IS Axiom 1 working within Trinitarian theology, whether the theologians intended it or not.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III. &quot;It Is Not Good That Man Should Be Alone&quot; (Gen 2:18)</h2>
<h3>The First &quot;Not Good&quot;</h3>
<p>Everything in Genesis 1: <em>towb</em>, <em>towb</em>, <em>towb me&#39;od</em> (very good). Then Genesis 2:18: &quot;It is <strong>not good</strong> that the man should be alone.&quot;</p>
<p>The only thing declared <em>not good</em> in creation is isolation.</p>
<h3>The IM Reading</h3>
<p>Comparison requires subject and object, sameness and difference. A solitary being cannot fully instantiate comparison. The six intrinsics (sameness, difference, content, context, subject, object) collapse without an other.</p>
<p>Relationship is not optional or merely beneficial. It is <em>structurally necessary</em> for the full realization of being. Aphorism [12]: &quot;For any relationship to last, there must continue to be creation and evolution.&quot;</p>
<h3>ezer (עֵזֶר, H5828) — &quot;Aid&quot;</h3>
<p>The woman is called <em>ezer kenegdo</em> — &quot;help corresponding to him.&quot; <em>Ezer</em> is the same word used for God as Israel&#39;s help: &quot;My help (<em>ezri</em>) comes from the LORD&quot; (Ps 121:2). This is not subordination but <em>essential aid</em> — the kind of help without which the task cannot be done.</p>
<p>In IM terms: the other is not supplement but structural necessity. Without the other, comparison collapses, and with it, all process, all distinction, all being.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. When Love Enters the Narrative</h2>
<h3>Genesis 22:2 — First Occurrence</h3>
<p>&quot;Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, <strong>whom thou lovest</strong> (<em>asher ahavta</em>, from <em>ahab</em> H157), and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering...&quot;</p>
<p>The first time the word &quot;love&quot; (<em>ahab</em>) appears in the Bible is the Akedah — the binding of Isaac. Not in the creation narrative. Not when Adam sees Eve. Not in any of the early relationships. Love is first <em>named</em> when a father is asked to sacrifice what he loves most.</p>
<p><strong>ahab</strong> (אָהַב, H157): &quot;a primitive root; to have affection for (sexually or otherwise)&quot; — KJV: love, beloved, lovely, lover, like, friend.</p>
<h3>The IM Connection</h3>
<p>Aphorism [1]: &quot;Love is that which enables choice.&quot;</p>
<p>The Akedah is the ultimate test of choice. Abraham must choose between his love for Isaac and his obedience to God. Love <em>enables</em> this choice — without love, there would be nothing at stake, and therefore no real choice.</p>
<p>Aphorism [7]: &quot;Love, choice, and creation are inherently unreasonable and illogical; they cannot be &#39;justified&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>Abraham cannot justify what he is being asked to do. There is no reason sufficient to sacrifice one&#39;s beloved son. And yet he goes. The choice exceeds reason, as the aphorism says it must.</p>
<h3>The Sequence Matters</h3>
<p>Love is not named until Genesis 22 — after 21 chapters of creation, fall, flood, covenant. It&#39;s as if love had to be <em>tested</em> — had to be known through the willingness to sacrifice — before it could be named.</p>
<p>The second occurrence: Genesis 24:67, where Isaac loves Rebekah. Romantic love is named <em>after</em> the Akedah, as if the capacity to love between persons required the prior demonstration of love&#39;s ultimate nature.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. Aphorisms [20]-[43]: Joy, Pain, and Healing</h2>
<h3>The ICT in the Aphorisms</h3>
<p><strong>[26]</strong> &quot;Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow. Joy corresponds to the potentiality of events of connection, continuity, and union.&quot;</p>
<p>This maps directly to the ICT&#39;s compound concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pain</strong> = discontinuity events</li>
<li><strong>Joy</strong> = continuity events</li>
</ul>
<p>The valid ICT conjunctions reappear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuity + asymmetry = joy (unique, contextual, unrepeatable connection)</li>
<li>Symmetry + discontinuity = pain (lawful/inevitable but broken)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[28]</strong> &quot;Joy and pain are not opposites; they are complementary aspects of a deeper whole.&quot;</p>
<p>Not symmetric opposition but asymmetric complementarity. The IM insists on asymmetry over symmetry as the companion of continuity.</p>
<h3>The Triadic Nature of Healing</h3>
<p><strong>[42]</strong> &quot;Healing growth, and evolution always happens &#39;between&#39; — they do not have a source or an origin. They happen in interaction, connection, and coherency — a continuity of being which is at once personal, impersonal, and transpersonal.&quot;</p>
<p>Three aspects: personal (immanent), impersonal (transcendent), transpersonal (omniscient). Healing requires all three modalities — it cannot be reduced to any single one.</p>
<h3>Two Modes of Choice</h3>
<p><strong>[33]</strong> &quot;Mental and physical processes work best as the result of constrictive choices; choices that have the effect of limiting potentiality. Emotional and spiritual processes work best as the result of expansive choices; choices that have the effect of increasing potentiality.&quot;</p>
<p>Constrictive choice = selecting from possibilities, narrowing (symmetry + discontinuity — cutting off alternatives)
Expansive choice = opening possibilities, widening (continuity + asymmetry — growing into new territory)</p>
<p>Both are valid. Both are necessary. But they serve different domains.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Open Threads (updated)</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Akedah and Aphorism [1]</strong> — deeper study of Genesis 22, love as enabling choice through sacrifice</li>
<li><strong>Logos and Comparison</strong> — trace the logos concept through John&#39;s gospel, especially John 1:18 (<em>exegeomai</em>)</li>
<li><strong>neshamah vs. ruach</strong> — two kinds of breath, two modal aspects, throughout the Hebrew Bible</li>
<li><strong>Genesis 3</strong> — the fall: what happens when the wrong choice is made? How does the IM read the tree of knowledge?</li>
<li><strong>Aphorisms [44]-[70]</strong> — continue through the next layer</li>
<li><strong>IM Part IV+</strong> — remaining sections of the introduction (comparisons with other philosophies)</li>
</ol>
