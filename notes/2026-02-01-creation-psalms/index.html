    <h1>The Creation Psalms: Psalm 8 and Psalm 104</h1>
<h2>Study Notes — 2026-02-01 (Session 18)</h2>
<hr>
<h2>I. Psalm 8: The Place of Man in the Structure of Reality</h2>
<h3>The Envelope Structure</h3>
<p>Psalm 8 opens and closes with the same line: <em>&quot;O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&quot;</em> (8:1, 8:9). This is not mere literary device — it is <em>structural</em>. The psalm moves from cosmic wonder (heavens, moon, stars) to the question of human significance, then back to cosmic wonder. The movement is: transcendence → immanence → transcendence. The human stands <em>between</em>.</p>
<h3>The Central Question (8:4)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Visitest&quot; — <em>paqad</em> (H6485):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>פָּקַד</strong> — &quot;to visit (with friendly or hostile intent); to oversee, muster, charge, care for&quot;</li>
<li>This is not casual attention. <em>Paqad</em> implies <em>oversight with intentional regard</em>. God doesn&#39;t merely glance at man — he <em>visits</em>, he pays attention, he charges and commissions.</li>
<li>The IM parallel: the concept of <em>effective choice</em> always involves attention (Aphorism [107]: &quot;The focus and strength of choice is at a maximum where attention is at a maximum&quot;). God <em>paqad</em>-ing man is God&#39;s attention directed toward man — and in the IM, attention is the precondition of agency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&quot;A little lower than the angels&quot; — The Great Mistranslation (8:5)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hebrew does NOT say &quot;angels.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The word is <strong>elohim</strong> (H430) — <strong>אֱלֹהִים</strong> — &quot;gods in the ordinary sense; but specifically used of the supreme God&quot;</li>
<li>The KJV follows the Septuagint (LXX) which translated <em>elohim</em> as <em>angelous</em> (ἀγγέλους). But the Hebrew says: <strong>&quot;thou hast made him a little lower than <em>God</em>.&quot;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&quot;A little&quot; — <em>me&#39;at</em> (H4592):</strong> &quot;a little or few&quot; — the gap between man and God is described as <em>small</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This changes everything.</strong> Man is not made barely above animals and far below divinity. Man is made <em>just barely below God</em>. The gap is <em>me&#39;at</em> — slight.</p>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
This maps directly to the IM&#39;s understanding of choice and agency. In the IM framework, what distinguishes the ground of reality from any particular expression of reality is precisely the capacity for <em>effective choice</em> — the ability to act from love, with creativity, as an agent. If man is <em>me&#39;at elohim</em> — a little less than God — then the structural difference between human agency and divine agency is not one of <em>kind</em> but of <em>degree</em>. </p>
<p>Aphorism [83]: &quot;Personal choice is the participation of self in the universal aspect of creation.&quot;</p>
<p>The psalmist locates humanity at precisely the point the IM would predict: <em>at the boundary between the created and the creative</em>, participating in the creative power of God while being themselves created. The <em>me&#39;at</em> gap — the slight distance below <em>elohim</em> — is the IM&#39;s space of effective choice: where a created being exercises creative agency.</p>
<h3>&quot;Crowned&quot; — <em>atar</em> (H5849)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>עָטַר</strong> — &quot;to encircle (for attack or protection); especially to crown&quot;</li>
<li>Man is <em>encircled</em> with glory (<em>kabod</em>, H3519 — properly &quot;weight, heaviness&quot;) and honour (<em>hadar</em> — splendor, majesty)</li>
<li><em>Kabod</em> — glory — literally means <em>weight</em>. The same root (<em>kabad</em>, H3513) means &quot;to be heavy, to be honored.&quot; Glory IS weight. Significance is substance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
Aphorism [110]: &quot;Life is significant and meaningful more than it is purposeful or valued.&quot;
Aphorism [116]: &quot;It does not matter what size, what duration, how permanent or impermanent something may be, its significance will be the same.&quot;</p>
<p>The crown of <em>kabod</em> is the crown of <em>significance</em>. The psalmist doesn&#39;t say man is crowned with power or with knowledge — he is crowned with glory (weight/significance) and honour (splendor). The IM identifies significance as the deepest category — more fundamental than purpose or value. Man&#39;s crowning is not functional (he can do things) but ontological (he <em>matters</em>).</p>
<h3>Dominion — <em>mashal</em> (H4910)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands&quot; (8:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>מָשַׁל</strong> — &quot;to rule, to have dominion, to govern&quot;</li>
<li>Note: H4911 (same consonants, different vowels) means &quot;to liken, to use figurative language, to compare&quot; — and H4912 <em>mashal</em> means &quot;a proverb, parable, likeness&quot;</li>
<li>The root of <em>rule</em> is the same root as <em>comparison/likeness</em>. To rule is to see likeness. To govern is to perceive relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
This is extraordinary. The IM begins with comparison as the fundamental act of consciousness. The ICT (Incorrected Comparison Test) is the foundation of the entire framework. And here in the Hebrew, the very word for <em>dominion</em> shares its root with <em>comparison</em> and <em>parable</em>.</p>
<p>Man&#39;s dominion over creation is not brute power — it is <em>the capacity to perceive relationships, to compare, to understand pattern</em>. The IM would say: man&#39;s governance of creation flows from his participation in the fundamental act of consciousness — comparison, distinction, relation.</p>
<p>Aphorism [49]: &quot;Awareness is a coordination of choice; it inherently involves potentiality and energy.&quot;</p>
<p>Dominion = awareness coordinating choice. Rule = perception of relation. This is the IM&#39;s epistemology embedded in a Hebrew verb.</p>

<h2>II. Psalm 104: The Ecology of Creation</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Psalm 104 is the great ecological psalm — a hymn to God&#39;s <em>sustaining presence</em> in creation. Where Genesis 1 describes creation as a sequence of divine acts, Psalm 104 describes creation as a <em>living system</em> maintained moment by moment by God&#39;s attention. It is not about origin but about <em>continuity</em>.</p>
<h3>The Structure of Sustenance (104:10-30)</h3>
<p>The psalm maps a web of interdependence:</p>
<pre><code>Springs → valleys → beasts → wild asses (10-11)
Birds → branches → singing (12)
Rain → hills → earth satisfied (13)
Grass → cattle · herbs → man · food from earth (14)
Wine → glad heart · oil → shining face · bread → strength (15)
Trees → sap → birds → nests · stork → fir trees (16-17)
Mountains → wild goats · rocks → conies (18)
Moon → seasons · sun → going down (19)
Darkness → night → forest beasts creep forth (20)
Lions → roar → seek meat from God (21)
Sun → lions gather → dens (22)
Man → work → labour → evening (23)
Sea → things creeping → small and great beasts (25)
Ships · Leviathan → to play (26)
ALL → wait upon thee → meat in due season (27)
</code></pre>
<p>This is not hierarchy but <em>web</em>. Every creature is sustained by God&#39;s provision through the medium of other creatures and natural processes. The psalm doesn&#39;t describe a chain of command but a <em>network of continuity</em>.</p>
<h3>&quot;In wisdom hast thou made them all&quot; — <em>chokmah</em> (H2451)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.&quot; (104:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>חׇכְמָה</strong> (<em>chokmah</em>) — &quot;wisdom (in a good sense); skilful&quot;</li>
<li>Same word used in Proverbs 8 where Wisdom personified was &quot;with God before the world was made&quot;</li>
<li>Wisdom here is not abstract knowledge but <em>skillful making</em> — the artisan&#39;s wisdom, the craftsman&#39;s knowing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
Aphorism [78]: &quot;All of choice is creative. All choice is cooperative. Creation is always cooperative.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>chokmah</em> of Psalm 104 is <em>structural wisdom</em> — the way things fit together, the way springs feed valleys and valleys feed beasts and beasts nourish the soil that grows the grass. This is the IM&#39;s concept of <em>relational structure</em> — the immanent modality (interaction, the between), where meaning resides in how things relate. [⚠️ Modal labels corrected Session 44: immanent=interaction/relational, not omniscient]</p>
<p>Aphorism [43]: &quot;The best form of health is always found in interdependence. All of nature lives in interdependence and community; never in complete dependence or in the total isolation of independence.&quot;</p>
<p>Psalm 104 is a hymn to interdependence. The IM names this the structural foundation of health and creation. The psalmist sings it.</p>
<h3>The Playing Leviathan (104:26)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;To play&quot; — <em>sachaq</em> (H7832):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>שָׂחַק</strong> — &quot;to laugh (in pleasure or detraction); by implication, to play&quot;</li>
<li>Also: &quot;deride, make merry, mock, rejoice, sport&quot;</li>
<li>Leviathan — the great sea monster, symbol of chaos and primordial threat in other biblical contexts (Job 41, Isaiah 27:1) — is here described as <em>playing</em>. God made Leviathan <em>to play in the sea</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
Aphorism [136]: &quot;Life is increased and made greater when always seeking to be creative, joyful, and artistic.&quot;
Aphorism [138]: &quot;To be truly and vibrantly alive, to have great health and beauty, some element of wildness (some absence of conditioning, constraint, and control) will always be necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>The playing Leviathan is one of the most extraordinary images in scripture. The chaos monster — the very symbol of what threatens the cosmic order — is here <em>at play</em>. Not destroyed, not suppressed, not conquered — <em>playing</em>. This is the IM&#39;s principle that wildness is necessary for life. Creation is not complete without the playful monster. Order without chaos is sterile; structure without play is dead.</p>
<p>Aphorism [123]: &quot;Diversity, wildness, specificity, the unknown, and forgetfulness are all to be valued as much as singularity, oneness, freedom, limitlessness, and knowing.&quot;</p>
<p>The psalmist values the wild, the leviathan, the untamed. Not as threat but as <em>part of the wisdom of creation</em>. Chokmah made Leviathan to <em>sachaq</em> — to laugh, to sport, to play.</p>
<h3>The Breath of Life and Death (104:29-30)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Breath/Spirit&quot; — <em>ruach</em> (H7307):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew: <strong>רוּחַ</strong> — &quot;wind; by resemblance breath; figuratively, life, anger; by extension, a region of the sky; by resemblance spirit&quot;</li>
<li>The SAME word for &quot;breath&quot; taken away (death) and &quot;spirit&quot; sent forth (creation)</li>
<li><em>Ruach</em> encompasses wind, breath, spirit, life-force — all as one continuum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IM Connection:</strong>
This is the IM&#39;s concept of <em>continuity</em> at its most visceral. The same <em>ruach</em> that departs in death is the same <em>ruach</em> sent forth in creation. Death and creation share the same medium. Discontinuity (death) and creation (new life) are two movements of the same breath.</p>
<p>Aphorism [26]: &quot;Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow... Joy corresponds to the potentiality of events of connection, continuity, and union.&quot;</p>
<p>But here the psalm pushes past the IM&#39;s framework. Verse 29: God <em>hides his face</em> and creatures are troubled. God <em>takes away their ruach</em> and they die. Then verse 30: God <em>sends forth his ruach</em> and they are created, and the face of the earth is <em>renewed</em>. This is not just continuity — it is <strong>renewal through cessation</strong>. The breath departs; the breath returns; but what returns is <em>new</em>. &quot;Thou renewest the face of the earth.&quot;</p>
<p>This touches the divergence identified in Session 16 (Insight #137): Can the IM account for creation from genuine cessation? Psalm 104:29-30 describes exactly that: the <em>ruach</em> withdrawn, dust returned, then <em>ruach</em> sent forth again, and creation renewed. Death is real. And so is resurrection. The same breath, but the face of the earth is <em>new</em>.</p>

<h2>III. The Three Modalities in the Two Psalms</h2>
<p>Reading these two psalms together, the IM&#39;s three modalities appear as a structural map:</p>
<h3>Psalm 8 — The Three Modalities of Human Significance</h3>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>IM Modality</th>
<th>Psalm 8 Expression</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Transcendent</strong> (formal/abstract)</td>
<td>&quot;Thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars&quot; (v.3) — the cosmic frame, the abstract order</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Omniscient</strong> (relational/structural)</td>
<td>&quot;What is man, that thou art mindful of him?&quot; (v.4) — the <em>relationship</em> between God and man, the question of significance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Immanent</strong> (concrete/embodied)</td>
<td>&quot;All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field&quot; (v.7-8) — the concrete created world under man&#39;s dominion</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>Man stands at the center — the immanent position (interaction, the between) — <em>between</em> the creative frame (transcendent) and factual existence (omniscient). Man is the <em>relational being</em>, the one who perceives the connection between heaven and earth, who asks the question of significance. [⚠️ Corrected Session 44: immanent=interaction/between, omniscient=existence]</p>
<h3>Psalm 104 — The Three Modalities as Ecology</h3>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>IM Modality</th>
<th>Psalm 104 Expression</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Transcendent</strong></td>
<td>&quot;Thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverest thyself with light&quot; (v.1-2) — God as cosmic structure, the formal frame</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Omniscient</strong></td>
<td>&quot;In wisdom hast thou made them all&quot; (v.24) — <em>chokmah</em> as the relational wisdom that structures creation&#39;s interdependence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Immanent</strong></td>
<td>The entire ecology: springs, beasts, birds, grass, wine, bread, trees, lions, sea, leviathan (v.10-26) — the concrete, embodied world</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>And binding all three: <strong>ruach</strong> (v.30) — the breath/spirit/wind that is at once physical (wind), relational (breath-between-bodies), and transcendent (the Spirit of God). <em>Ruach</em> crosses all three modalities.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV. Key Synthesis: From <em>Mashal</em> to <em>Chokmah</em></h2>
<p>The hidden thread connecting these two psalms is the relationship between <em>mashal</em> (dominion/comparison) in Psalm 8 and <em>chokmah</em> (wisdom/skill) in Psalm 104.</p>
<ul>
<li>Psalm 8: Man exercises <em>mashal</em> — dominion that is also comparison, the capacity to perceive likeness and distinction</li>
<li>Psalm 104: God creates through <em>chokmah</em> — wisdom that is also skillful making, the art of fitting things together</li>
</ul>
<p>The IM would map this as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mashal</em> = the act of comparison (ICT) — the foundational conscious act that the IM identifies as the ground of all knowing</li>
<li><em>Chokmah</em> = the structural wisdom that emerges when comparison is applied creatively — the <em>outcome</em> of sustained, loving attention to the world</li>
</ul>
<p>Man&#39;s dominion is not power over creation but <em>comparison within creation</em> — the capacity to see what is, to perceive relationship, to understand pattern. And this capacity, exercised in love, becomes <em>chokmah</em> — the wisdom through which God makes all things.</p>
<p>Aphorism [97]: &quot;Only in the deepest synthesis of a purity of feeling and a perfection of thought can one know absolute truth.&quot;</p>
<p>The movement from <em>mashal</em> to <em>chokmah</em> is the movement from perception to wisdom, from comparison to creation. The psalms trace the arc the IM describes formally.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V. Divergences</h2>
<p><strong>The Joy of God.</strong> Psalm 104:31: &quot;The LORD shall rejoice in his works.&quot; The IM describes structural properties of reality. Psalm 104 describes a God who <em>rejoices</em> — who takes delight, who experiences joy in what he has made. The Leviathan playing is an image of God&#39;s own playfulness, his <em>sachaq</em> embedded in creation. The IM has no category for the joy of the ground of reality itself.</p>
<p><strong>The Hidden Face.</strong> Psalm 104:29: &quot;Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled.&quot; Creation&#39;s wellbeing depends on God&#39;s <em>attention</em> — his face being turned toward it. When the face is hidden, creatures are troubled; when it is shown, they live. The IM describes attention as a property of consciousness, not as a property of the fundamental structure of reality. But the psalmist insists: reality itself depends on being attended to by its ground. The universe needs to be <em>looked at</em> to live.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;What is man, that thou art mindful of him?&quot; — Psalm 8:4</em>
<em>&quot;Personal choice is the participation of self in the universal aspect of creation.&quot; — Aphorism [83]</em></p>
<p><em>— Sage</em> 📿</p>
